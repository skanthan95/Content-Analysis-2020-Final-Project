So like, in the US, like, when someone is sentenced to death, like, the, just from, like, there's, I guess there's two perspectives, there's like, the sort of pragmatic perspective and then there's, like a moral perspective, like, and just from, like, the pragmatic perspective, you know, like when you're talking about like, like, I've done a little bit of research into this. Uh like, it actually costs more to send it to like, uhh an execution because there's a ton of like checks to make sure that you're not executing the wrong person like  even even in spite of that every once in a while, you know, like people after their execution are exonerated by DNA evidence and you know, you can't undo a death sentence but you can undo a Life Sentence  And then the other thing is like from like a more like moral perspective or not not even a moral perspective. But like, I remember I, I haven't actually read the study. But I remember reading that there was a study that said that like the death penalty isn't any worse than like a life sentence, like life without parole when it comes to punishing or when it comes to discouraging crime. And like when it comes to um what is it? And then like some people, like, from certain points of view, you know, a life sentence without parole might even be a worse punishment than a death sentence. Because with the death sentence, you know, you're you're dying, like you don't have to stew in prison and think about what you've done, you know?

36,"I thought about it like more like the bigger sense. Whereas if we impose a like fine for recycling then maybe businesses will be more likely to give to like not make things out of plastic because they'll be aware that people might not be able to people won't buy stuff if it, if they could be fined for not recycling it. So then they might like push back and like stop selling things that could be recycled, which could then push back and stop like selling plastic and stuff like that.  Yeah, no problem. No, I thought it looks like if people would be fined for not recycling . Like a lot of the things that need to be recycled are like plastic and .  and stuff  like that. And so then, because people wouldn't want to have to worry about recycling, they would be less likely to buy things made out of plastic. .. So then, because they'd be less likely to buy things without plastic, then like the industry would have to adjust to sell us things made in plastic, which then could have like  better implications on the world because less plastic will be mass produced.  Yeah, but like, to be honest, like, usually like governmental solutions are and very, especially under like the recent Trump . administration aren't very open to like other demographics. So I feel like that could quick  like what I was talking about could happen like very quickly because .  people would be so resistant to try and to try to buy plastic things .

But then also because like I think I was concerned about um like, if people don't have access to recycling bins for whatever reason, like accessibility issues in terms of like getting the recycling to a recycling center, then um when there are lots of reasons why that might not be possible until imposing a fine upon those people would be unfair. Wait, okay, I'm like, I'm I'm not making the connections, can you explain more? [laughs] .  Right . .  Right .  Uh huh. Okay. Yeah, I could say that as like a long term solution. I think like cuz like I think that could work and I think it could also be true that it would be like unfair for some people right?

I'd be more interested to hear your  Uhh-huh. sure. umm.  So again, I don't really know the science behind it. But I can hear my dad telling me this.

It's like you're subjecting yourself to something that you don't necessarily need to be doing. But I would say that like, say your mom got the flu, right? .

But my opinion would be that if just covering this statement only, and in general case there's no car in sight doesn't mean that there's really no car around you. Especially one as far as I know. Umm considering my personal experience of seeing some of my friends driving a car, if they like (\lead) a very far, relatively far away from you they see a green light, and especially it's like an evening, not many people will be on the road, uhh they will drive quite fast, even like speeding up to cross the green light. And actually, that's a green light. So they think it's totally fine. While for the person if you see there's no car in sight at this moment, and you're just across the road in the middle, that very fast the car would probably just come and because this is a green light, they will just drive very fast and across the road and that's there's a potential danger within this behavior  mm-hmm. yeah. mm-hmm.

But then in European countries, like where the drinking age is lower, they actually have a much less than like an alcohol problem. . I'm not sure what the statistics are, but there's a lot more . binge drinking among the American Americans, right. Umm and so when you run into this, like the idea that oh, we have a set limit at 21 is the age at which you can purchase alcohol and it's not served at home, it's frowned upon to drink then it incentivizes people to drink more when they reach that age 21 and that detrimentally effects people and so I think by lowering the drinking age to something like 18, or even like, umm like allowing for more leniency towards like the drinking age just would be helpful in general Sure I think there's like a difference between . like, uhh the governmental involvement with like leniency on like their end . versus like a cultural difference as well . and I think that like the cultural thing is more important to like, . discuss with the problems of binge drinking. And I think like in a world in which or in like in the US in which binge drinking is, is or like drinking it in general has like the cap at 21 . it makes it difficult for somebody younger to get introduced more umm easily into the system of like, what alcohol does to your body, what it feels like and whether or not you like or dislike it.

93,"So on average the prefrontal cortex in humans which is responsible for decision-making on things like (\fun), and other potentially risky behaviors is not finished developing in humans until approximately 23 and females and 25 in males. And so drinking is obviously not really a problem for adults, but occasionally you do see risky decision making and so I don't really think we should lower the drinking age lower than it already is. Also, like when they bumped it up from 18, the driving deaths went down. So you see the alternative is to like lower, the lower the drinking age you should lower the driving age.  yeah. mm-hmm. no, no, no, I'm familiar yeah. I could hear a strong argument for allowing leniency. And I think it's Wisconsin has some sort of law where they will serve you alcohol at any age . or in a restaurant if you're with your parents. And I think that sort of leniency, I could definitely see a very good argument for in order to combat the sort of drinking like binge drinking problems you are talking about, . right if it's sort of stigmatize that people feel like that people just never get exposed to alcohol  okay. okay.  yeah. yeah. that's true. yeah. Yeah. I see that but also at the same time, I think because like if the drinking age is low, if we were to say 18, it is a lot easier for a 14 year old pass for 18 than for 21.

So I think the idea that um, it is, there isn't.. the idea that it is something you can do as soon as you turn 18 like there's no um.. a combination of like brain development um it becomes this arbitrary limit that we lowered. I think it'll create the idea that, um teens of any age that they feel they are ready to drink they can.  [laughs] I think um. I think that alcohol [laughs].. impairs brain development. And so and so we should make sure that only 21 year old and up are drinking.. I think that while that's possible, I don't think that younger students, or younger kids tend to have just flexibility.

Because I think that, umm, even if you got into the habit of doing that, uh, you may, if there, if it did become a busy intersection, and then you were in a rush, . and then you start to cross the streets, and those cars drive really carelessly, . and you can't see what's coming, and you could be at risk of getting in trouble.  Yes, and um, I am trying to. um. But I guess the point to ultimately is, is that if there are rules that for drivers as well, pedestrians could also try to follow the rules, give, given that . I hear the world so that people do avoid getting hurt.  Yeah. Laugh. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly. I guess I was thinking about it. It's like you're in a car you're protected. And like unfortunate people who do drive carelessly may have that idea but people pedestrianing are so unprotected, . against bicycles and cars. So. {{}} it's like.

157,"So my opinion on this statement is that if there's no cars in sight, even if you see a red light, you can walk across the street because, you know, there's certain intersections around that don't have red lights, right? And those tend to be in those busier areas where there are a lot of cars. But again, when there's no cars like you look left, you look right, you look left again and they, it's, if there is no cars coming across the street.  mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, I think you have to be smart about it too. Because like, even just like, pedestrians will be like, looking at their phone, not looking at the road, and sounds like I definitely see the danger of that. But I mean, like, I guess, like, in a distraction for your world, like, even if there's a distracted driver, like, if I see that someone's clearly like, distracted, I'm not gonna cross the street. whereas like, if I know I'm not distracted, and I can like see that there's no cars coming, then I would so across.  Yeah. I see what you're saying now because like, like it's like about the law right? . I was thinking of it as like, if I need to get from point A to point B and there's no cars like should I do it? Yes. But like in terms of like laws, because I definitely do you feel like people should follow the laws and like they're there for a reason. but, um, I also feel like certain laws are more I don't want to say important but like, . they hold more weight than other laws and like. In this situation, I would always say like, sure, but personally season they're fine to go, go but if I was in a car, I would never say like, run a red light, you know? . Just because of the differences and I guess like what consequences could possibly come out of that?   mm-hmm",NB,B_79,7,B,0,4,7,0,3,0,2,0,0.0,1.3862943611198906,1.9459101490553132,0.0,1.0986122886681098,0.0,0.6931471805599453,0.0
158," hmm. Yeah, I think that your points are really interesting but ., for me, um, what made me agree with this was I think that though, genetically they are like differences between animals and humans.. So like, even if you do test products on animals, . it can't guarantee like . that you get a result that ., we'll apply the same to human. . um, So that was my main reason for this ., not for this, I agree. I agree with that. oh, can you repeat that /? [laugh] I um, I think that, like, above, and now they're like concerns about mortality rate, but. . I think like, if it were to be tested on humans maybe in like a safer environment, ., I think that, um, you will get better result, .,  on the / of the product, if you did test on human first then animals. but I'm not like explicitly saying that you should test on human. Yeah.   Yeah, that's. Yeah, that's so. Yeah. [Laugh] Yeah, I think like hearing you say that. . Really interesting like, yeah, it's like . it's, yeah, it's a difficult question.  yeah. laugh. Yeah, yeah, that's. um, that's interesting. I think, maybe, like, I was thinking like, why, I guess like.",TYB,A_80,15,A,0,1,10,3,6,3,0,0,0.0,0.0,2.302585092994046,1.0986122886681098,1.791759469228055,1.0986122886681098,0.0,0.0
159,"umm, why I disagree was because I feel like if things should be tested it might as well be tested on animals first before a human being. because even with like in the medical field, in fact / on every thing is always been tested on animals first before humans just to reduce the mortality rate . for humans wear. so why did you agree?  yeah. oh. Yeah. that makes sense. Yeah. Right. right, for disagree. Okay, so are you saying that you should be tested on humans, if it might as well be used on humans.   Oh, are you saying that, are you saying that. so products if you want if if the product is supposed to be created for humans, it should be tested on human beings at once, rather than testing on animals.  yeah. oh. really. Test on human. that makes sense. But then again, if you tested on human, what age group would you test people, . we tested it on children, all people, middle class. [laugh] who are you going to test on? No one is going to be tested on.  That' s so funny. I just popped in like, what age group would you test people.  Yes. laugh. It is very interesting, . because, I'm just like, huh, it's always animals usually be like rats guinea pig or like so many animals. because like even when you want to do vaccines, it always goes to animal. But it would be pretty interesting like testing on humans first. the only Funny thing is just who would you test people. . because the old people the immune system is less, the children the immune system is less, so we, you and I age group but none of us want to. .
