Person B  0:11  
um, I guess like I would say that I just think that teenagers like deserve privacy and like there's some things that like parents don't need to like necessarily walked in on, I guess. um. And then also I feel like it just helps give them a sense of, um, of privacy in space and like if parents respect that space, I guess. It's like if they don't have a lock on their door, but the parents like always knock before then I think that's okay. But, um, yeah, I guess I guess I would just say like..[Person A: not] Yeah.

Person A  0:49  
Yeah like I'm, yeah, like I agree with that. umm. It just it was kind of interesting because I had a lock on my door for the first, like my first two years of high school [Person B: oh] and The thing about that was that I like never came out of my room and [Person B: oh] I just kind of like chillin in there lock the door please don't bother me. And I feel like I've like would, I-I find myself spending a lot more time actually with my family when I don't like what I don't have a lock on my door. [Person B: oh, that's a good thing.] Yeah, I-I don't know why but I mean at the end of the day like, I think I can see both ways. like in for like a parent's perspective obviously I don't think they want they would love to have a lock on their kids door. but like for teenagers for the longest time, I didn't want my, I want to lock my door and then I realized like my parents do knock so, [Person B: Yeah] so I just so like, I don't find like a huge need for it but definitely for like, very basic parents. I don't. 

Person B  1:44  
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. I never I guess I never thought about like spending time in your room. I guess like if I there were times where I would like be locked in my room and I would just not come down but then my parents would physically come upstairs and be like, okay, you have to come downstairs now. [Person A: uh, Yeah, absolutely] so I guess that that's a good point, though. Um, I feel like also just like with siblings, like, whenever I would be showering [Person A: actuallly] I would like because I have, like I have brothers. And so like, I just want to have my door locked when I was showering because my bathroom door didn't lock. And like, [Person B: uh] a lot of times, they were really invasive. And they would just like, play pranks on me while I would be in the shower. [Person B: Yeah. That's funny] So or like they would come in my room and mess stuff up, while I was in the shower, so I really should face that. So

Person A  2:29  
I-I'm definitely agree. I think a bathroom lock, like, [Person B: Yeah] and that's definitely a must have. Um. I think for having a lock in your room. [Person B: Yeah] I think it just goes both ways.

Person B  2:39  
Yeah, it's interesting, because like, I have a lock on my room now and I don't use it. It's just like, [Person A: you have] Yeah, I have it. But I never really use it.

Person A  2:48  
Yeah, I get your points and that makes a lot of sense. [Person B: Yeah]. I mean. I. it's one of those things where it's like you always want and [Person B: Yeah] then like once you once you get it you're, you know you use it and then like [Person B: Yeah] and but.

Person B  2:58  
Are you still in high school? 

Person A  2:59  
Yeah, senior year. 

Person B  3:00  
Okay, so that makes sense because [Person A: yeah] you are still teenagers and I am not.

Person A  3:03  
Turning 18 today. 

Person B  3:04  
Oh-oh, that's so cute. [Person A: Yes]. Happy birthday. 

Person A  3:07  
Thank you so much. 

Person B  3:08  
But that's interesting that [Person A: Yes] your perspective is like different 

Person A  3:12  
Yeah.kind of weird, but [Person A: Yeah]
