Person B  0:32  
Umm--I think..I mean I'm a fan of affirmative action.. my family is a black umm so it was like beneficial, yeah that's basically it [laughs]

Person A  0:44  
Yea, that's fair..um I think for me uhh..I think it comes from like more personal experience like with my family like umm with, like how school sometimes will try to meet certain needs of like certain ethnic backgrounds based on like, what they want their numbers to look like, right? Like percentage wise. Umm but I totally understand like what you're saying.

Person B  1:07  
Yea, I think both of us agree [laughs]--

Person A  1:08  
[laughs] Yeah, yea there's like always two sides to every--

Person B  1:10  
--Yeah--

Person A  1:11  
--Everything and like, I think it just depends on like, to your personal experience and like,how things have affected you in your life like like with uhh how you like to think.

Person B  1:21  
I agree, I also think like, in an ideal world I would also think it should be blind.. you know what I mean?

Person A  1:26  
Yeah, yeah--

Person B  1:27  
Like I think if like public schools are better and everybody had equal opportunities----and like treated everyone fairly then like-- 

Person A  1:31  
--Yeah----Yeah----Yeah--

Person B  1:34  
Um so I think ideally, like, some schools wouldn't have to request like the breakdown of society--

Person A  1:43  
--Yeah-- 

Person B  1:43  
--like that should happen naturally 'cause it doesn't right now. I don't know. 

Person A  1:46  
Yeah, I agree umm--Yeah, and I think that's really relevant with like, how like, obviously we have like patterns and like how socially like socially things are broken up like hierarchy wise--there are obviously patterns and like resources for people and like I obviously want that and it's very relevant um as far as that goes um--

Person B  2:06  
Yea, I think it's interesting that they're like I agree, especially--

Person A  2:13  
I think like yeah, I mean, I think that's very specific and interesting that they chose that, but umI don't know I guess like--I don't know I think of I guess it's a--you're, I'm assuming a student also?

Person B  2:30  
Yeah

Person A  2:30  
Um I think like because we're also at like a higher level of school, I think that's probably trying to like really--

Person B  2:36  
No yeah--I guess I was just thinking like, I wonder if I would change my opinion if it were like a public school or like, I wonder if that matters?

Person A  2:43  
Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean?

Person B  2:45  
Like, I don't know. Cause, like....yeah, I don't know. I don't know. [person A: laughs] How that changes things--

Person A  2:52  
I think if it was like a public school, there would be like, because Ivy league schools  are obviously like,more exclusive [person B: mhmm]. Um I think that kind of like changes the way that makes up students as far as like, requirements, so I think it's more // in that way like, obviously--

Person B  3:06  
--Yeah--

Person A  3:06  
--people want
