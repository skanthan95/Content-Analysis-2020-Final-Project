Person A  0:25  
Like sometimes it just wanted something that's not that healthy or something like that, but--

Person B  0:32  
--Yeah--

Person A  0:32  
--I think just high school should have the option to--

Person B  0:34  
--Yeah--

Person A  0:34  
--be able to offer that. But as I said, I do kind of think that you know, most food that high schools offer should be healthy. It's just not a flexibility sort of thing.

Person B  0:45  
Yeah. Yeah, I guess like the sticking point there is like the only right?

Person A  0:49  
Yeah

Person B  0:49  
Yeah, I don't know. I'm a high school student right now. So I sometimes wish like, my high school only offered healthy food because I think for me, like it would be easier to make choices if all the choices healthy choices. 

Person A  1:01  
Yeah that's true. {{}}

Person B  1:01  
And I feel like I make a lot of choices like during the day. That sounds so like whiny, like I want to make less choices but like sometimes it'd be nice to like-- 

Person A  1:10  
--Yeah--

Person B  1:10  
--I wouldn't have to always like choose to not eat unhealthy food you know what I mean? 

Person A  1:14  
Yea, that's pretty fair.

Person B  1:15  
Yeah, I don't know.

Person A  1:18  
Yeah, that kind of like that they don't they don't give you a choice then you have no choice what so ever-- 

Person B  1:23  
Exactly, right? Yeah, or it's like the whole like stupid like Steve Jobs thing where he's like, you should only you should like dress in the same thing every day. 

Person A  1:31  
Yeah, yeah.

Person B  1:31  
So you have like less choices to make sometimes I wish like healthy eating could be like that. Like it'd be so much easier if you didn't have to worry--

Person A  1:37  
--Yeah--

Person B  1:37  
--about that. But I guess the only is a good point. Because I think if there were days I was like, I absolutely could not find anywhere to buy chocolate then I'd probably be like, pretty sad. 

Person A  1:47  
[laughs]

Person B  1:47  
Yeah, you know what I mean?

Person A  1:49  
Really true. Another thing is like, uh probably bills might be more expensive //--

Person B  1:55  
--Yeah--

Person A  1:55  
--if they mandated only just like healthy meals that--

Person B  2:01  
--Yeah--

Person A  2:01  
-then uh that's a little harder to work around that if you're trying to come up with meals to serve the people.

Person B  2:09  
Yeah.

Person A  2:10  
Or stuff, you could like have alot of other options as well.

Person B  2:12  
Yeah, that is actually I think a really good point.

Person A  2:15  
Yeah,  so it might be harder  to offer like low income uh. student lunches.

Person B  2:18  
students. Yeah, yeah, I guess also the question is like, what is like, like, how do we define healthy, you know? I don't know.

Person A  2:26  
Yeah, that's hard [laughs]

Person B  2:26  
People define healthy in like def-- in like really different ways.

Person A  2:29  
Yeah, it's like, certain meals can be healthy or not depending on like.Your own medical conditions,Like your overall diet.

Person B  2:38  
Yeah, like what you're. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's a really good point.

Person A  2:41  
It's hard to know. [laughs]

Person B  2:41  
Yeah. [laughs]. Like, fill the last 25 seconds. Um--

Person A  2:47  
Yeah.

Person B  2:47  
Yeah, no, I think that's a good point. The idea of like, people's own individual needs impact what they mean by healthy.

Person A  2:55  
Yeah. 

Person B  2:55  
Um, yeah. I don't know. It's weird that this is where we had the most disagreement. I feel like, like out of all those questions, but yeah, I guess you never know.
