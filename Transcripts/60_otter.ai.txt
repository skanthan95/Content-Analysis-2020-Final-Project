Hi, Um, so I ranked that pretty low just because I don't think jay-walking really is.. um, a bad thing. I think in actuality like people tend to be pretty good judges of like when they should cross the street and when they shouldn't..

Person A  1:14  
Mm-hm.

Person B  1:14  
..um there can be actually more accidents at crosswalks..

Person A  1:17  
Mm-hm. 

Person B  1:18  
..um, because people are following the signs and they're not looking at the cars, they are following the signs, and the cars may be going or not stopping and then they get hit.

Person A  1:25  
Ya.

Person B  1:26  
So I think generally like jaywalking is pretty harmless and people are pretty good at assesing danger for themselves.

Person A  1:33  
Gotcha. Okay, cool. That's a really good point. Thank you for bringing that one up. I I agree that and I'm I'm in the similar boat have been many times and I figured I was a good enough judge that I would cross the street as well. This is actually a tough conversation for me. I'm spending most of my time in England right now. And, uh, there's different rules in England.

Person B  1:49  
Oh really?

Person A  1:50  
Than in the US. Yeah, yeah. In England, you can cross so as long as no one's around, and so, so that's kind of why I put in some actually. And if not from the US, I would have put it higher and the only reason why is more just.. two reasons, I guess. One, just the way I was brought up, I was kind of brought up, just follow the rules of the road, you know, even if it's something that I don't necessarily agree with, just something that I should do if it's required of me by those who are in authority.

Person B  1:54  
Oh wow! Cool. Mm-hm. 

Person A  2:16  
So kind of just like a respect for authority thing. Um, but then also, look at a lot of the people that got hit and hurt while jaywalking. Probably a lot of them would have thought that they were good judges of when they should cross too. So there's just seems, some sort of a lot of uncertainty to letting people decide for themselves when is a good time to do certain things, and not certain things. So

Person B  2:38  
I mean, I think that's fair. I don't know. [laughs]

Person A  2:41  
Ya [laughs]. Well, I appreciate I appreciate that you, uh, that you thought about it and that you are.. uh that you know that its...

Person B  2:53  
Ya.

Person A  2:53  
...an interesting thing. Yeah. 

Person B  2:56  
Yeah, 

Person A  2:56  
I think it's it's tough because in a lot of situation I hate waiting. 

Person B  3:01  
Yeah. 

Person A  3:01  
So so it for me, it's usually a battle between some sort of moral feeling that I have. And then frustration. And..

Person B  3:09  
yeah 

Person A  3:09  
sometimes I win morality over frustration, but sometimes frustration wins over. [laughs]

Person B  3:13  
[laughs] Yeah, that's true.

Person A  3:14  
Yeah, definitely. {{{{{{{}}

Person B  3:15  
Yeah. Also like, I guess my thought was like, also it tends to be like even when there's no cars in sight versus like, I think it's kind of a different position when there's like, oncoming, like ..

Person A  3:26  
Ohh

Person B  3:26  
..you see a car coming from the distance. Like..

Person A  3:28  
That's true..

Person B  3:29  
..I feel like in that situation weights a little bit differently than when if like you see no cars. 

Person A  3:33  
Ok..

Person B  3:34  
Well, yeah. I don't know [laughs]

Person A  3:36  
No ya, I like that. That's a really good point.. So So what you're saying is there could be some sort of a rule..where, if you can see a car coming along, um I think it's really important. One question I have then is, like, one of the issues that might come up with some court cases would you be able to separate

Person B  3:40  
Yeah... Yeah, right like how do you tell? 

Person A  3:50  
..so there were no cars in sight...
