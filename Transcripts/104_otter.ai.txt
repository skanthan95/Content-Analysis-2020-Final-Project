Okay, so I think that in like a day and age where technology so problem and like so many people have iPads and like some books and laptops, it's not even really necessary for schools to use that much paper in the first place. So I think that even if they were fined for using whatever paper they use, it wouldn't be that much of a fine anyways. umm. Also, I mean, I just think like given an effort to like save the environment, like recycling is something that's really easy to do. And I don't understand why like schools especially have like so much organization and they can like kind of delegate that task to other people. But just I think like, there's no reason not to do it. So if you're not doing it, you could suffer like a consequence or some..

Person A  0:55  
Okay, umm, I, um, I'm. Thank you for explaining your concern. umm. I think, uh, with I don't know, I mean, I put tears intense for just about everything I'd cry on second thought I'd probably put something closer to five. I think whether an issues is that I often, um, when I'm going to recycle something, a lot of times I'm actually not sure, uh, whether I can recycle it or not if it's for example of something that was had food in it or something that's been like used like a piece of paper that's and, I'm, I'm just not sure. so I think right now I just I've never and I've never had any instruction on specifics in terms of, uh, what exactly can be recycled or can't be recycled. So I think considering that, umm, I think it could be a little harsh to do, do something like um Institute of fine however, I think if there's sort of maybe like a quick just, you know, uh, sort of quick seminar to, [Person B: Yeah] you know, um, to the school to just like, state like okay this, you can recycle, this has food on it, don't recycle it. um, There's a lot of food if there's a little food, I don't know. um, so I think that if that's the case, then I would be more agreeable to this. But um, I-I think it should, and and that's something that should be right the case. [Person B: yeah] so, I don't know. I think in the end of it, we're pretty kind of agree. Umm, Yeah.

Person B  2:21  
Kind of agree. Yeah, and I think like, especially like schools. There are so many schools so like, like, why not give them a fine? I don't know. [Person A: Yeah. yeah] like it- iwtill justify to force them to be more cautious about it.

Person A  2:34  
Yeah, I mean, I'm and umm, that said, I think we're, uh, allocating people or [Person B: mm-hmm] security to, like, uh, Institute these specific rules and something like this, um, pray hard to keep track of. I think it could be somewhat of a waste of resources, but I think If there's a way that can, you know viably sort of happen that's definitely something, you know, to / to. But you know, it would be difficult to. [Person B: Yeah] but yeah, obviously
