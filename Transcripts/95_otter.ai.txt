I felt like I strongly disagree because I basically use my phone to // with everyone 

Person A  0:19 
To do what?

Person B  0:19
To make connect with everyone, like my family and the family and. If I'm dining with friends, I need to be able to know if my family needs something. 

Person A  0:27  
I see. But if that's true, then why don't you have your dinner right now? Like, are you not worried about your family? Or like why is it on table, {hide it?} from the table?

Person B  0:35  
Because I can't feel it most of my pocket? 

Person A  0:38  
Do you think that's distracting them from our conversation? 

Person B  0:41  
I don't think so. Because if if I didn't have my phone on me, I'd constantly be worried about whether someone needs to reach me and can't. But like this, if they do need to reach me, I know that they can.

Person A  0:51  
Go on your phone buzzes? Are you checking in because, for example, it says people should never be allowed to text while they're interacting or like having a meal? So do you do that when you're like having a meal with your family? Like, they can't be worried about you, if you're there in front of them. 

Person B  1:09  
Um, if I am, I can't have a meal with my entire family because they're spread out so far, but, um, if I'm having a meal with someone and like I get a text, I'll usually answers either say, Oh, I'm busy, text me later or it's like, if it's a big deal, oh, excuse myself on the table, but I will text while meeting.

Person A  1:28  
But I feel like fundamentally like what is the point of having a meal with someone? Isn't the whole idea to like, socially interact with them, sort of empathize with them? And how are you supposed to do that if you're also in another world with someone else? like that kind of negates the purpose of the meeting to begin with.

Person B  1:45  
Um, I guess most of the people I eat with I see every day. So like, it's not that big of a deal to text at that time. 

Person A  1:55  
I see. But I guess cumulatively over the course of the year, you will get out of the time that you miss having meals with them every day. And also like we go on breaks, we won't see each other for a while when you graduate, you may not see them ever again for the rest of your life. Does you feel worried about that? 

Person B  2:13  
Because I know that later if you do want to see, they can text me and I'll respond.

Person A  2:17  
But it's not the same thing is being with them right? You don't really get their essence over text you.

Person B  2:21  
Uh, for some people I prefer communicating over text, it's sometimes easier 

Person A  2:28
How so?

Person B  2:28
To, they are more confidence over text, or they're more willing to say their opinion.

Person A  2:34  
But how will you develop that intimacy in person, if you don't have any practice? 

Person B  2:38  
I feel like you are doing interview now. Oh sorry. 

Person A  2:46
But also answer me [laughs] 

Person B  2:50
I think since usually just because I have my phone on me and I would want to have to be able to talk doesn't mean I will, so most conversations that we have face to face not won't being interrupted. 

Person A  3:03  
Okay, but how do you think that makes the other person feel like.
