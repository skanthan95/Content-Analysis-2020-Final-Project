Okay, so I guess my perspective on this is influenced by the fact that I'm probably a little bit older than most um like people on this campus and my experience with computers and other electronics is  limited and then I also have friends my age who have kids now that are like toddlers. And to see them like the way that they interact with the iPad--I don't know about never, but my feeling about it in general is pretty negative, because they tend to fixate on them so much. And I just know that like, there are-is research about the benefit of kids doing things other than just like electronics. And it can be really easy to give an iPad to a kid to like distract them especially if you're in public, but that I guess my more nuanced feeling about it was that you shouldn't let them have like an on bettered access to the iPad, in lieu of other things when there's other you know activities they could be involved with.

Um yeah I appreciate your insight on this. Umm I guess for me, like you said, like you're a little bit older. Um but I've also grown up in the, in the age of where it's like, you know, electronics aren't really the biggest thing um how to be how to entertain yourself as a kid like, iPad wasn't really created yet when um I was like growing up, and my family didn't really invest in electronics [person B: mhm]. Um and so we learned how to have fun with the traditional way [person B: mhm] imagination and stuff [person B: mhm]. But then um the thing is, because I also think that, you know, iPads shouldn't really be used for kids like, as their entertainment source as their main one [person B: mhm], especially because, like you said, yeah, they get fixated on it, but I feel like it shouldn't be. It-it shouldn't be like never [person B: mhm] just because when the as like each year passes [person B: mhm], you know, we're becoming so much more dependent on technology and like, you know, we're changing the um, as we like, grow as we're getting older [person B: mhm] the generations keep changing and like, you know, it's like, oh old people don't know how to use electronics, right? So so it's up to like the younger kids to teach [person B: mhm] them. Um, I guess it's kind of about like, adapting to the current circumstance. That's why I feel like that they should have some access and so like, you know, that's why I put, um I think a 6 [person B: mhm]. Whereas like I don't think there should be like--they should never have it, but I feel like they should have like some access, but not a lot.

I think the phrasing as toys was what threw me, like--because yeah I would definitely put it in terms of like toys, toys that encourage more of an  imaginative style [person A: mhm] of play is more appropriate. But yeah it is true that like ..I mean this question is going to be absolete in 10 years like you're just going to have some kind of device-- 

Person A  3:22
