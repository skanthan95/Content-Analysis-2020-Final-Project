Um, I think, I, well, I guess when I buy skin and hair products, I don't pay attention to whether or not they're testing on animals. And I actually am not aware what brands are testing on animals, but, hmm, yeah, just some I use a different kinds of products, I [laugh] don't know, just not very aware of it.

Person A  1:04  
I'm- I'm glad that you brought it up because it's hard to be, hmm, like to be aware of where everything you bought comes from right [Person B: Yeah] hmm, and even if you try to make ethical purposes [Person B: Yeah], it's probably not ethical at some point in the /, [Person B: Yeah]. um, but I still think it's important to like try to do, hmm, make ethical purchase when you can. That's my stance, I...

Person B  1:30  
Oh, do you know like what products?

Person A  1:32  
I don't know either. [Person B: laugh]. here's the problem, so I guess, um, since this is a good point that, hmm, I don't really know what is ethical or not, [Person B: Yeah], um, when I buy things. hmm. I probably should try to know what they..

Person B  1:47  
[laugh] Yeah, no, I just yeah, I guess, I-I think I want to be more towards that. Like, I guess there's some products. I don't know. I think there is some product I use every day that I've used for a while, and I just don't want to make a switch, [laugh] [Person A: yes, that is a good point.] really look into whether or not like you have been used on, you know [laugh]

Person A  2:08  
Yeah, that's a good point. I guess that's true. hmm. It's like we buy a lot of things that are not made ethically [Person B: yeah], anyway like we don't like iPhones and iPads are not made / right. [Person B: yeah]. hmm, so, and it's hard to switch and find alternatives [Person B: yeah], because work is well. hmm. So I'm glad you brought that up, but you know..

Person B  2:31  
Yeah, okay, that's fair. hmm, do you know like how they test animals? Did they use are all animals?

Person A  2:37  
Yeah, so like they'll use like, snails is like replacements for whips or something. or stuff like that. [Person B: wait..How? {{}}] .. put it on the snail. Like no, like on the snails' skin. Yeah. [Person B: and he would happen?] Yeah. It's like some of us is pretty bad. 

Person B  2:54  
I don't understand how that even translate into

Person A  2:56  
I don't know I that's just like what one that I've heard of. hmm. [Person B: Oh.] So I don't even know like what they do. But I know they do do animal testing. It's not.. um.. /

Person B  3:07  
Yeah, I don't know. I didn't.. and I actually {{}} no. I guess I could know these things // you know. He didn't know. [laugh]. I don't know if it's very common.

Person A  3:18  
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I guess that's a good point is that most people don't really know. [Person B: don't realize.] Yeah, as hard to do research and not have to switch the whole thing. hmm.

Person B  3:28  
[laugh] I feel like there is a product that did that they wouldn't exactly advertise that they're using it on. [laugh]

Person A  3:33  
Yeah, that's true. So it's hard to find out what's actually [Person B: Yeah] better or not.

Person B  3:39  
That's fair.
