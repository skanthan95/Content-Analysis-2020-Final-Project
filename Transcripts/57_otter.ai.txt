I think the US should lower it's drinking age because people are drinking anyway, and there's no reason for you to keep it up.

Person A  1:00  
But that I think that that will always be true. [laughs]

Person B  1:03  
[laughs]

Person A  1:04  
So even if you lower the drinking age, then even younger kids will think, oh, well, this drinking age is set here, but it's fine to drink more then. And then you'll just see more students drinking.

Person B  1:16  
 I agree, but I don't think.. I don't know how effective or like how many people would be thinking that way like thinking, "Okay, so now here he is like 18, I'm 16 originally I feel like I'm like five years away from not drinking age. Now, I'm two years away. So now I should, I would be more inclined to drink. I don't know how true that would be though...

Person A  1:41  
I think it makes sense. We already see some high school students, um high school students who have access to alcohol. So I think the idea that um, it is, there isn't.. the idea that it is something you can do as soon as you turn 18 like there's no um.. a combination of like brain development um it becomes this arbitrary limit that we lowered. I think it'll create the idea that, um teens of any age that they feel they are ready to drink they can. 

Person B  2:10  
So what's the negative consequence of underage drinking?

Person A  2:13  
[laughs] I think um. I think that alcohol [laughs].. impairs brain development. And so and so we should make sure that only 21 year old and up are drinking..

Person B  2:24  
[laughs]. Um..but not necessarily that also impairs brain development but it's also like how much alcohol. So like if people who are like currently under age like for example, 18 or 20, they get drunk personally because they like enjoy that underage drinking feeling. Then it probably, it's probably better to lower the age limit so that they Don't feel like "okay, I'm underage, I'm drinking, this is so exciting like so maybe they would not drink as much if the age was lowered.

Person A  3:12  
I think that while that's possible, I don't think that younger students, or younger kids tend to have just flexibility. So, so even younger kids, if it becomes more available will be more likely to make, like bad decisions and also just be drinking more alcohol than other people who maybe more responsible [laughs] 

Person B  3:36  
[laughs] I don't know... okay...
