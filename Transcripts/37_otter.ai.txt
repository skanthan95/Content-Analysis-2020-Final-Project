So I think that Ivy League schools should be blind to candidates' race and ethnicity. Umm not entirely but I think that it's it's significant to the extent that I don't think that it should be a factor in like, whether or not you're admitted to a school or not.

Person A  0:24  
I disagree. I think that, especially given like that we live in a society where there is all sorts of like race based barriers and systematic barriers that people face. I think someone's race and ethnicity and how they grow up in this society umm I think it plays a big factor in understanding what barriers have they had to overcome to get to where they are, for example, right, an African American student has faced all sorts of issues about systematic racism, you know, redlining, right, like whatever school district they're from, and so I think it's very important for the school to take that into account. Uh to understand that, you know, if you have like a white student from an affluent part of the country, and then a black student from, you know, [Person B: yeah] not affluent part of the country, you can't weigh them completely similarly, because one of them has had all sorts of race based privilege that the other one does not. 

Person B  1:14  
Sure, yeah, I agree with that. I don't think that race should be kind of an absolute category that's determining, like admission versus not admission. I do think that [Person A: mm-hmm] it's for inferences of factor to some extent. [Person A: mm-hmm] But a lot of those issues are also ingrained in other parts of your application outside of your race, for example, like whether you go to a less privileged district, [Person A: mm-hmm]  what my point is just based on purely like geographic region, (there is a lot of thing that do not mean burden?), but I think it becomes difficult when you kind of attach like a label to one of these and a lot of schools [Person A: mm-hmm]  are using things like quotas to, like stop people from certain races, for example, to get admitted higher rates because they have this like, for example, like only we're makes up like 5% African Americans [Person A: mm-hmm] in our institutions. So I think perhaps there's a little bit of difference within using these quotas. But I do think [Person A: mm-hmm] that it has a factor and it definitely plays a larger role in their educational background [Person A: yeah] and their experiences.

Person A  2:06  
 I just think that like the, you're like, a little bit missing the point about, like how much this can influence all other aspects. Um, just because, like, I'm not necessarily saying that, you know, you should admit or not admit someone because of this, but I am saying it does completely change how you understand kind of whatever life story or you know, kind of version of themselves that they're portraying too. Because, you know, even you were talking about location, right, [Person B: yeah] like, it's not a, you know, 100% correlation. [Person B: Sure], sure. But it is still a huge factor and even like, if you are, they see for example, right, like, [Person B: yeah-yeah]  there's racism that you cannot get away from, even if you're born into a single rich family, even if you know, you get all these privileges, there are still certain aspects that you kind of cannot escaped better just like intrinsically tied [Person B: yeah] because America is very racist [Person B: yeah] and a lot different
