So are we just going first then [Person A:  mm-hmm] Alright. Umm well so I think there are cases when you know they need it I mean like for example, like you know, you come here and like well you're gonna go somewhere and you need some phone communication so then you basically want them to have one of those I mean, and there's a question of like, you know, how much they are allowed to like how much of cell phone they're allowed to use, like, for example, like smartphones. [Person A:  mm-hmm] But then is that a good idea? That's something that was not in the questions I just say like, having it or not having it i think i'm just you know for the idea of like umm having one of those I am not saying like, you know what they are allowed to do inside there [Person A: yeah] but

Person A  1:06  
yeah, I guess I didn't think of the perspective for emergency purposes but I disagree that they should have it because I get concerned about children communicating with you know strangers, umm you know, or talking to their friends and getting bullied, you know, via cell phone, [Person B: right right] if it's a smartphone, you know, getting bullied by someone via text message and we don't know about. 

Person B  1:31  
Right, exactly. So that was that was really like you know, like my uhh point is that basically that you know, like you have Yeah, like you should be able to control [Person A: mm-hmm] like, like, what they can do on their phone. [Person A: Yeah], but then I agree in that you know, you basically can't control like everything like you know, even if you allow for like, you know, simple like call and text, you know, a lot of weird things can happen so [Person A: Yeah] that's one thing Yes, I agree. [Person A: hmm Yeah] And also - 

Person A  2:05  
I guess you're-I think it's more nuanced than I originally thought when I [laughs] answered this, because if there was a way to set the settings where it's like, they can only contact these people, you know, [Person B: yeah yeah] like family members [Person B: yeah yeah]  nothing else. I would be okay with it. [Person B: yeah ] But I wouldn't want my kid on a cell phone, like a smart cell phone [Person B: oh yeah probably not like basically like] until they are ten or nine years old  

Person B  2:28  
Yeah, no. Yeah. Well, I mean, I agree with that. It's just the question wasn't really asking such things like the [Person A: yeah; laughs] kind of cell phone, like there are things and that's basically what like most of the companies are working on, right. [Person A: mm-hmm] I mean, like, they can control like, they're under control. [Person A: yeah] So it's basically just trying to deal with this problem. So I was thinking, so

Person A  2:50  
yeah, I was. I guess the question isn't as uhh clear [laughs]

Person B  2:56  
Yeah And I don't think it was well posed [Person A: yeah],That's the issue with the issue that was posed, I think I do not agree [Person A: mm-hmm] with the statement. [Person A: Yeah]
