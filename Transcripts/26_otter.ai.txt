Uhh clearly this is a topic that is complex in nature, but in my opinion, I think that umm not a lot of emphasis should be placed on someone's race or ethnicity. I think that people should be given opportunities umm that uhhh may provide you with advantages that you haven't gotten but not that it should be exclusive.

Person A  0:34  
No, I see your point about uhh including more people--including more people. Um, I personally think though that like uhh equalities are important, and if we want all  equality, I don't think we can. I think it's dangerous to pick and choose what equality would choose. So it's I-I so I think uhh though, it is very important to have diversity. I think uhh  equality is a little more important then letting uhh everything be fair and choosing experiences. 

Person B  1:11  
--equality and  experiences do you mean for umm--diversity-- 

Person A  1:17  
equality and opposites. I mean, sure, sure. No, I mean, like so I mean equality in the sense  that uhh one shouldn't be given an advantage because of one's race or ethnicity.

Person B  1:33  
Thank you /// Umm and I think that could go either way. That could be umm obviously more learning //. So // you hate to  eliminate people so it's not as extreme. But then, it shouldn't be based exclusively on one's race-- 

Person A  1:59  
Yes, yes, for sure, yeah. So, uhh what do you think the benefit, uhh besides diversity on a campus would be to being blind?

Person B  2:25  
Yeah, what would it turn out to be? if they were blind verse

Person A  2:28  
Yeah, I mean, they.--yeah would it even be diverse, like more diverse, you know what I mean?

Person B  2:29  
It might be less diverse?

Person A  2:29  
Yeah.

Person B  2:39  
Maybe there's other ways of evaluating umm at looking at a person now, that could indicate these experiences for race it could be exactly their race--

Person A  2:52  
--yeah--

Person B  2:52  
--like maybe there's some more complex--

Person A  2:54  
--yeah--

Person B  2:54  
-- evaluation that could take place umm that has to do maybe with umm characterization one-one's experiences rather than--
