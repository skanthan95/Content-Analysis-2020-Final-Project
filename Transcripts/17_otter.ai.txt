Okay, so I put strongly agree, because I just feel like the legal age right now is 21. I believe right? Yeah. So I feel like teenagers are too reckless. So I don't think that they'll be responsible for their actions. Because when you're in a intoxicated state, it's really hard for you to control your bodies, especially for teenagers, because they just started and they just finished puberty too. So I feel like the US should just keep what the age is right now. Yeah [laughs].

Person A  0:38  
Uhh I really appreciate your point of view [person B: laughs] um that I actually think um not so strongly agree, but I think uhh it can actually lower a little bit. Uhh I really agree that teenagers are really hard to control themselves. But I think like, um for examples for me, I'm like 18 years old [person B: mhm], so I think as an adult, I think I actually have ability to control myself and make my own decision [person B: mhm]. So uh my point of view is just like a lower the legal drinking age, but not so low.

Person B  1:18  
Mmhm okay.That's a good point, actually [laughs]. Yeah, I was thinking about that, but then I don't know I think you kind of convinced me there 'cause if you think about it...Since the, uh the age is so high that we like teenagers do things more recklessly while you // [laughs]

Person A  1:38  
Yeah, and I also think like, for like some teenagers [person B: mhm] maybe like of our ages, if you like prohibit [person B: mhm] them to drink the alcohol then some of them may have some like sense of rebellion, [person B: mhm] and even try harder uh and do not have some really correct perspective about this so.

Person B  2:04  
That's a very good point [laughs] . I was just thinking of like the consequences that can come from it, but then like, that's actually a very good point. Because if we would like preventing them for doing things that is just going to make them want to do it even more. 

Person A  2:18  
--Yeah. [laughs]--

Person B  2:25  
What age are you thinking of? Like 18?

Person A  2:28  
Yeah. I think 18 is / 

Person B  2:30  
Yes, that's true. 18 wouldn't be so bad. I just feel like this is we just got out of college you know, so yeah, I mean, not college, high school so yeah, but yeah.[laughs]
