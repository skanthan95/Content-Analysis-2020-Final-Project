Person B  0:14  
Yeah. So I actually don't really have a strong opinion on this one. But the reason I picked zero is precisely because I don't have a strong on this one. So, I just feel like if I forgot to do and I get fined, I will be on ///

Person A  0:27  
That's fair--

Person B  0:27  
Yeah, so, yeah--

Person A  0:28  
--that's very understandable--

Person B  0:30  
Yeah, so what did you choose?

Person A  0:32  
Yeah--

Person B  0:32  
Did you put 10?

Person A  0:33  
I think that's really understandable. I did pick 10.

Person B  0:35  
Oh, okay

Person A  0:37  
 I think like corporations and schools seem to be the places that use the most paper and just would have a lot of uhh potential for waste. And I think that uh to encourage them just to like incentivize them to be better about the wastage, I think that it would be smart to impose a fine I do think what you said is correct, though, that like if people just happen to forget they would still have to pay the fine--

Person B  0:59  
Yeah [laughs]

Person A  0:59  
But I think uhh I think just reinforcing that behavior would really be beneficial. And I think that if we are going to address climate change and a lot of these environmental issues, I think we have to tackle the biggest producers of waste first. 

Person B  1:12  
Yeah, I agree with that. Yeah, but I guess like cuz I'm really not on the other side of recycling and then pulled up like wouldn't the-- like, well, what would it mean to not recycle a paper because like there's like I  garbage can I just put paper in there and then like / people //.

Person A  1:32  
Yeah--

Person B  1:32  
So-- 

Person A  1:33  
And then I think that would just mean it goes into landfill. 

Person B  1:35  
Oh, okay 

Person A  1:36  
Definitely would uhh, like biodegrade at some point, you know what I mean, but I think it's probably better that it goes to like a recycling joint--

Person B  1:44  
--Yeah--

Person A  1:44  
--where they can immediately reprocess that into like into new paper--

Person B  1:47  
But how would you like actually track, like how would you track people for -- like would you use surveillance cameras?

Person A  1:53  
--Yeah--

Person B  1:53  
I don't know 

Person A  1:53  
 --there's definitely I think that's a really great point. I think there's an enforcement issue with this, but I think that uhh yeah, I wonder maybe just like they would have to report how much paper they use like how many reams of paper they buy like things like that, you know, but that's true. I I really wonder I at a local level how that would be enforced of adjusting. Do you feel like uhh overall though, recycling even in like personal households should be like a requirement that you should recycle what you can?

Person B  2:26  
Uhh well, I guess it's definitely a good thing to recycle, but like there more common resources to like, easily help you to Iike start getting started on it----that will be better like just to provide you some like very easy / to, so that you know what to do. As I--Yeah, it's pretty complicated sometimes. 

Person A  2:45  
--Yeah--Yeah, I wonder what a good metric would be to like determine how much waste each place produces 

Person B  2:58  
Yeah

Person A  2:59  
It really would just have to be self-reporting I think they'd have to like talk about how much they have how much that used. How much has gone to waste but very interesting--alright?
