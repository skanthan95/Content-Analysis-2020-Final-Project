Person A  0:10  
Oh really, Okay, uhhm so I-I think the reason I put 10 was I-I just thought like, as long as medical condition permits meant, like, they're like safe to take like it, you know, it won't hurt them. And I was also assuming I guess that like the cost would be covered or something. Um uh an-and so that it would just be like a net benefit thing, because um when you get a flu shot, you can't make other people sick.

Person B  0:41  
I think I really like your concern about the not affecting the others {{}}, but the reason I put um a pretty low level of agreement on this system is a--personally, I don't take flu shots very regularly. Although, I always get asked by the nurses: "would you like to schedule an appointment?" I just feel like I don't necessarily want to visit the clinic. 

Person A  1:08  
Yeah, I know. I totally agree with the practical thing, because there are definitely times when I just am like lazy. I so yeah, ever maybe okay. Everyone's like should, but in reality--yeah, I totally feel lazy and just don't sometimes but yeah, yeah, that that makes sense. 

Person B  1:27  
Yeah, I really like your quoted / because I had a bit of a debate on what "should" here mean by definition? [laughs]

Person A  1:38  
Uh-huh

Person B  1:38  
I though should is sort of a strong word--

Person A  1:42  
There might be like some cost to doing it that I'm not thinking of like the fact that you have to like take the time to go and maybe the shot is painful or something and that like that maybe that cost something that really should be considered, well that that like is part of getting a flu shot that I wasn't thinking about so--

Person B  2:01  
Yeah, I really like your point about uh the net profit to the society which I think if this instead of a crucial some sort of more serious vaccination I would be more on the 

Person A  2:12  
Uh-huh--

Person B  2:12  
--strongly agree side.

Person A  2:16  
Yeah, I-I don't know about maybe it wasn't the best language but but yeah, like if it was.. I don't know diseases, but yeah, you're right like some some stronger thing--whereas the flu is like eh, but um I mean, I haven't been sick for a while so I don't know--

Person B  2:34  
Oh, don't say that! 

Person A  2:35  
You think like it might like jinx it or something? 

Person B  2:37  
[laughs] Probably, that's just uh-let's hope that doesn't happen.

Person A  2:46  
Yeah

Person B  2:47  
And also, seasonal is very frequent--

Person A  2:50  
To get a shot every season?

Person B  2:52  
Right

Person A  2:52  
 Yeah, I mean I would still say maybe people should, but I can see why someone wouldn't

Person B  2:57  
Uh-huh
