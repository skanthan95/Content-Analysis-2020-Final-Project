Oh, well, so just because you don't see on the side..It doesn't mean that they're like hidden cars around [Person A: mhm]. And this like really moving really fast and you can get into car accident. So, yeah.

Person A  0:52  
Right, yeah, I mean [Person B: laughs]-- no, I-I-I appreciate you-your opinion. I think I think it is true that um you know, there-there can be unexpected cars coming in uh when uh when you go across the road, even regardless of whether it's a red light or not. Uhh on the other hand, I feel like well, I mean, so the red light is-I mean sort of there um, I guess for a purpose. I mean, it is is sort of there. Well, I-I guess to be like an indication of like, when when it's appropriate to to uhh cross the road, // walking across the street, I think that's right...Right, right. So I mean, I mean, if I mean, I feel like, uhh for-for people who umm I mean, there's always a risk of-of maybe having a car going around and things like that. And so I feel like well, it would be nice if uhh yeah, right, actually, I agree with you sorry I don't know what to say but that yeah,yeah sorry [person B: laughs] I mean uh it's really uhh it's always better to be risk averse because I feel like well, the thing is like, if you are fearless for once, then while the downside is very--

Person B  1:07  
Right--

Person A  2:04  
--the risk is very huge right, so?

Person B  2:04  
Yeah. I agree. 

Person A  2:07

Person A  2:14  
Yeah, exactly.

Person B  2:15  
--or like it's broke [laughs]. 

Person A  2:15  
I feel like when it's like this especially like around  I feel like sort of the red lights like they're not always [person A: mhm] like, like like--

Person B  2:22  
--yeah--

Person A  2:22  
--on or something and then like, it's also not clear like whether the cars always respect the red lights so yeah--

Person B  2:30  
--[laughs] right--

Person A  2:30  
--no, I really really [person B: laughs] agree yeah with it makes sense [Person B: mhm] umm yeah, do you?Yeah, I don't know uhh sorry --But yeah, no, I-I-I think your-your opinion this is-is great and uhh I agree   with you.

Person B  2:51
