Well, initially my first thought behind it was even at 21, I feel like people are still so underdeveloped and irresponsible. So it's like lower. I feel like people's minds are really developed to make, um, sound decisions about like drinking because they're still learning and developing as teenagers. So that was my first reason for saying like, just leave it like why make it lower would be /? Technically make a sound decision about anything at that age. So why give the person opportunity to drink something that will further, um, impair them. 

Person A  1:00  
Yeah, no, I get that. I mean, [Person B: that was it. laugh] I'm like, I'm supposed to say I'm I disagree with that. and That's that's how I disagree that [Person B: Yeah] say stuff. But I'm I'm from Turkey originally. So I lived in a country where the drinking age was 18. [Person B: uh]. I'm culturally, I'm European. So I'm very exposed to a system where people are okay with drinking once they become 16. Okay with soft drinking, which is like beer and wine before after the 16th. And then they're okay with drinking all kinds of stuff after the 18 [Person B:Yeah], and I've had this argument with a lot of people and I like I-I-I actually believe that because the drinking age is 21 in the United States, people believe, people think that drinking is worse than it actually is. [Person B: Sure] I think that because drinking ages is 21 people believe that is such a dangerous thing. And they ended up drinking so much that they // whereas in Europe, despite having a drinking age of 18 people do drink but they drink lower quantities while eating as well. So I feel like in order to embrace that kind of a drinking culture, we have to push the drinking age lower, [Person B: that makes..] which has also helped with like, a lot of // problems to give up. 

Person B  1:00  
Yeah, I understand that. // I feel like a lot of times, people in the US are more immature in general. [Person A: mm] But people from like where you're from, I feel like teenagers especially have qualities that make them a little bit more mature. So they're able to like, you know, [Person A: yeah] like, / my friends that I'm encountering a little bit more mature than teenagers are from here, so.

if you like one big thing also is that like, if you're drinking legally, you're paying to drink, right? [Person B: True] You're at a bar, you're paying to drink if you're belligerently drunk. You also pay a lot of money to get / be drunk. [Person B: That's true.] So you stop yourself not only because you're drunk, but also because you're losing money. [Person B: Exactly] But if you're just drinking alcohol that was bought by a person who's 21 or was bought with a fake ID, you don't have the limit. You don't stop yourself because of the financial concern. And you also don't stop yourself because you're too drunk. [Person B: that's true.] I feel like if people were drinking legally, they would drink less.

Person B  3:15  
Yeah. I feel like I understand that point of view, too. I really do think that if it was / it lower, it would have to be like, I can't just lower the drink age and not like, [Person A: yeah, exactly] yeah, there has to be a.
