Sure. So I guess when I first I was kind of skimming over the question. umm. When I first saw it, it was more just like the parents should use their iPads to like, you know, help as like an educational tool for toddlers um, with toys I guess like. I don't know. I-I still think it's okay. umm, Just because, like, realistically a kid is going to have to use electronic equipment and like, you know, in their lives, like, especially now. So like, I-I don't I don't think there's anything wrong with starting them early. umm. But yeah, and that's really un..

Person A  1:18  
so I can appreciate that they're going to use technology for their life once again, it's completely reasonable to let them experiment with it early on. [Person B: Yeah, sure]. Um, I guess my only concern is I would be I feel like, especially as toddlers, you always hear that they have that they should interact with parents and [Person B: Sure] as many people as possible [Person B: Okay, Right], connect toddlers to,  you know, teachers and anybody else in the world. [Person B: sure] and so it's like to give them just the iPads as toys. Like, it's an educational tool, which you can use that advantage. [Person B: sure] But then as far as just giving it to them to like, be quiet in the car. It's like you're missing out on so much educational experience with the mom, or the dad is saying like, oh, we're gonna play this game. We're gonna do this [Person B: okay] So just like social interaction.

Person B  1:59  
Yeah, I guess I'm not make sense to. I mean, I-I think realistically, it's like, whatever is best for your kid. And um, I just think like maybe like, when I think of like so maybe like in that situation would be more like, ipads makes the isolation and like when parents are going somewhere else. And that thing is you are definitely right, it's a problem. umm.I just don't know if that's necessarily like, for example, my kids, I don't know if I would do that with them. [Person A: mm-hmm] I would definitely I, if I were to integrate my electronic equipment, I would just be like, teach them to use it. Especially get it so importantly, you know, trying to directly I don't know, as a toddler I don't really know how adult look like but um, yeah, I mean, I think I think you definitely bring up a great point. um, Yeah, I wasn't really sure that.

Person A  2:37  
Oh, Yeah, I completely understand it's like, you don't know what your parent like, what your parental, I guess guidelines would be you [Person B: sure] want to put an attitude. [Person B: Right, right]. Um, it's like my cousins are much younger than me. And so they received that thoughts really young. [Person B: Oh, yeah] and I think it, it doesn't, like in my point of view, didn't inhibit them at any point.[Person B: Okay, sure] But it's also like the debt like that, your mom definitely said you will go exciting you will play sports, [Person B: Right and that's definitely important. Yeah] and put your ipads away. so its just like as toddlers, as a toddler should really even know how to use //, it's been a like..

Person B  3:10  
That' s fair. They just gonna do stuff with that right? That's fair.

Person A  3:13  
Cause they do want to replace maybe three other toys that had like lights and sounds and then it'll do the same.

Person B  3:19  
Sort of the same thing. Okay. Okay, I guess that makes sense. Yeah, I guess it's like sort of like a on a spectrum. You know, like, just like keeping everything in balance. Yeah, I don't know. I just like don't really know, like, what would be wrong with like, just like, making them play with an ipad like, you know, even that it's like, yes, it's whatever, as long as a year and as long as you're doing something outside, so that
