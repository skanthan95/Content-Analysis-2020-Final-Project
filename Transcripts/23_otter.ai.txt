So, I personally think physician assisted suicide should be legal in the United States completely um because uhh like regular suicide is very dangerous and has a lot of harm for pain umm, so I think a assissting people that are in their like very last and painful hours of death is probably like the best way to send them on. And um currently the laws are that uhh euthanasia like doctors can be criminalized for that um and I don't think it's correct. What's your opinion on it?

Person A  0:45  
I don't think it should be legal because..I believe, well I believe in dying when you're destined to. Andin some sense if the physician umm sorry, the physician like could have access or could have intentionally killed a patient [coughs] without but the justification would be that it's assisted suicide, for example, this would be a rare case, but it could happen. Um also, I would agree that definitely if the patient is in tremendous pain, and there's no way of the patient recovering from that pain, and the patient confirms that he wants he or she wants to die, then it should be made an exception for that case. But if you're talking about a person on the street who wants to kill themselves, I don't find the need and I don't see the demand for physician assisted suicide.

Person B  2:03  
Okay, so your interest is in medical cases?

Person A  2:07  
I'd yeah, I would say just for medical cases--

Person B  2:11  
--Ohh okay--

Person A  2:11  
--it would be a complete umm.. If anything, you'd probably want to invest more in suicide prevention rather than prison position assisted suicide cure, because you're acknowledging, like--

Person B  2:28  
 I don't think that's what the question is, though--

Person A  2:31  
--but--

Person B  2:32  
--just making it legal doesn't mean that we're not be putting in money into suicide prevention.

Person A  2:37  
No but, it's implying that because you're, you're like your opportunity costs as well. I mean, you gain more--

Person B  2:44  
I don't think that's what the question is saying. I don't think just making something legal, like forces us to like not put resources into other assistance programs 

Person A  2:56  
Right--I don't know--[laughs]
