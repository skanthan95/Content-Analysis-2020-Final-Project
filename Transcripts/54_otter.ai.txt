Okay, so yeah, I don't think that everyone should get a season flu shot. I don't give the shot myself because I don't really get sick, like ever. I feel like I have a really strong immune system. So it's just like, for me, it's not necessary for me to take the time out of my day to go get it done when it's not going to hurt me to not get it done. And I have a ton of other things like going on. You know, in my day, like I have two jobs. I'm a full time student you know, like, it's just not convenient for me. So like I don't worry about, um.. getting, getting one.

Person A  1:01  
No. Yeah, that makes sense. And I, yeah, I appreciate that sentiment. I think, I think where I'm coming from is like, I've always done it. And so, and like, I guess I'm also coming from the same standpoint of like, it's always worked and like, um and I also think herd immunity is something that I know a little bit about, like, not as much as I should, obviously, but um..

Person B  1:27  
What do you know about herd immunity?

Person A  1:29  
I mean, just like, what like, I don't know the exact number but like 80% of people need to have it in order for the immunizations actually take its full effect. And so because of that, it just made sense. However, I do know that like seasonal flus are like, changes so rapidly as I...

Person B  1:48  
Yeah, I also, I don't know, like, maybe this is just like, individual differences. Like I also like, don't get that like close to that many people. Like, I feel like I'm not like, Like, if someone is sick or something like I'm coming into contact with them. So it's just like another reason why I feel like I'm not worried about like, getting the flu shot like, you know, how you carry hand sanitizer like you cover your mouth is like I feel like pretty basic things that keep you like healthy like during the cold and flu season.

Person A  2:15  
Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, like...Anyway.. haha. Yeah, um, yeah, I think that's really important cause like individual responsibility, right? Yeah, I guess. For me I was thinking like it wouldn't hurt some make it required... 

Person B  2:47  
Yeah.

Person A  2:48  
Um but also, I do think that, yeah, just like you said, just like freedom of what you do with your body. 

Person B  2:56  
Yeah. I mean, like, if it was required, I wouldn't have a problem with doing it and like I'm sure that it probably would be beneficial for others who like do have weaker immune systems.

Person A  3:04  
Mm-hm.

Person B  3:04  
...um but like also there are people, I'm not one of these people, but there are people who like are afraid of needles, you know, who like you don't want to like go through process like it's, you know, makes them anxious and makes them nervous. So there's like those kind of people who maybe like should have the option to like.. not.. like to opt out.

Person A  3:22  
Ya, uh-uh that makes sense... um Huhh I'm stressed to start something else haha..
