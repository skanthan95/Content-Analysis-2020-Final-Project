So I think something that I don't know. This is like a really like a tricky topic, [Person A: yes?] I think something that, um, that why I-I lean one way or the other as like, I-um I've seen just experiencing a lot of friends who have gone like, throughout their entire lives not being exposed to alcohol and not even knowing anything about alcohol, just suddenly going completely crazy when they have access to it. It's it's something that-it kind of worries me [Person A: laugh]. I don't know. It's, it's like, do we lower it and then people will start drinking younger, but then there's also like, it's it's very tricky. I don't know, what are your thoughts? 

Person A  0:50  
Well, I mean, I understand that there will be people who have never been exposed to alcohol [Person B: mm-hmm]. But I also understand that currently the drinking age is 21. [Person B: mm-hmm]. And that's about a third year undergraduate if we're taking that into account. And I think honestly that people should wait. I know it gets a lot of college students upset because they're already away from home and they're like, I have freedom I want to drink, I want to do this [Person B: mm-hmm] and that. But at the same time, they're still they're still young. And I don't think the age should go any lower because even then, are like their brains are still developing until the age of 21. [Person B: mm-hmm] It's also why they put restrictions on legalize weed, and then are not  supposed to like, smoke it until 21, because the brain is still developing. 

Person B  1:29
Yeah.

Person A  1:29
So we already know alcohol inhibits you. So who say it's not going to.. [Person B: Yeah], well affect your brain? [Person B: Yeah] even more than it already is. 

Person B  1:37  
Yeah. And that's-that's the other thing that's like, so confusing about it, too, is because the brain is still developing until 25 or 26. So why 21? I-I don't know. It's just for me that's like very complicated and everything's like very nuanced and then also like spending a lot of time in Europe with my family like I've noticed a lot of because the drinking age is younger, a lot of kids don't go as crazy as often and they treat alcohol with more respect, which I think- is kind of interesting. um..

Person A  2:04  
I do think that is fascinating, but we also have to understand is that in Europe, they allow their children to drink wine…

Person B  2:09
That is true.

Person A  2:10
…which is a huge difference between hard liquor and vodka and others, [Person B: That is true], unless we take into account Russia. [laugh] But at the same time, wine is a little bit different on the alcohol level, because, it's, I like I'm not a wine person, and I'm also not an alcoholic. I'm-I'm not, I don't drink alcohol. [Person B: mm-hmm] this is also while again, I'm against lowering it. But it's not for family reasons like that alcoholism [Person B: mm-hmm] runs in my family, but it's that my own Bobby actually started me young online, and I'm fine with that. But at the same time, I don't like it, [Person B: Yeah] and he started me when I was at eight. [Person B: mm-hmm]. But I know a lot of kids sometimes start even younger than that, and it can be okay, which is fine with wine, but when we get to the hard stuff, like Mike's hard lemonade, oh, [Person B: yeah], all this party or / or all that cheap stuff. [Person B: mm-hmm]. It becomes a little worrying. 

Person B  2:58  
Yeah, yeah. I know, no, that's understandable and it's like I really have to look like a different experience it to us I think [Person A: yeah] that always ties into everything
