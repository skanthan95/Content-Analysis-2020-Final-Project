So I said that, um I think the parents should be free to use iPads as toys, [Person A: um-hmm], for their toddlers, [Person A: um-hmm], although, I definitely agree it's not ideal for whatever development, [Person A: um-hmm], so if I might have, [Person A: um-hmm], but I feel like parents are just really overwhelmed. [Person A: Yeah]. And if they, I'm thinking of a specific situation where they like failed to get a nanny [Person A: um-hmm], or a baby-sitter, and they have to bring the child to the public, and if they're misbehaving, [Person A: Yeah], and that's the only way. And I see this a lot in Korea. [Person A: um-hmm]. I know that this is like a really good way to keep them shut off. {{}} to the.. [Person A: Yeah] to the life of a parent, [Person A: Yeah], as long as they don't like do this even at home or like, yeah, but the y [Person A: Yeah] don't have the option. [Person A: um-hmm] Maybe they shouldn't. [Person A: Yeah] But I also generally disagree that like the never statement, [Person A: um-hmm], and I feel like people should not like say one should do this, [Person A: um-hmm], not do this, especially when it comes to parenting. [Person A: um-hmm] But that's my 

Person A  1:33  
No, yeah, I totally agree. Especially when it comes to so I've worked with kids some [Person B: Oh-okay]  for like, almost a decade or something like that. I'm working on becoming a teacher. [Person B: uh-huh]  hmm, and it's like really attempting to like use iPads [Person B: um-hmm] and like works to get the job done. [laugh] [Person B: Yeah] And I was also i'm also like, always for like, not a big one for like, never statements or always statements. [Person B: right] um, but I also feel like just the effects of exposing children so young to like the internet to like technology, the damage does to their eyes. [Person B: um-hmm], um, the way it's like hard to really regulate the things that come across on the internet, [Person B: um-hmm], on iPads [Person B: um-hmm]. I mean, granted, like you can, but in like [Person B: right] all the literals stops and whynot. [Person B: right] But I feel like there's so much to gain of like, being able to like give your child like a bug [Person B: Yeah] or like give them like a workbook or like coloring or something like that before, while they're like in this like critical stage of development. [Person B: um-hmm].Yeah.

Person B  2:41  
 Yeah. Yeah. I agree.But I feel like the coloring stuff [Person A: um-hmm], you can do it on pad. [Person A: Yeah] Yeah.

Person A  2:49  
Yeah. And I guess it's just like a lot of stuff. Almost everything you can do like without an iPad you can do with an iPad or a tablet. [Person B: Yeah] um, But I guess it's my thing is really ground. Still trying to make sure that like the next generations to like grounded in like the physical reality and not the virtual [Person B: Yeah, that's a point].Yeah

Person B  3:09  
Nine seconds. [laugh]

Person A  3:10  
Nine seconds? [laugh] but, no yeah. I feel like either way as long as the child is healthy and happy. [laugh]
