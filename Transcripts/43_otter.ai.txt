Hmm. The reason why I disagreed with the statement just because I feel like if there are no cars in sight and there's no point to just staying there.

Person A  0:44  
Hmm. I disagree with you. I think that, hmm, people create habits, and if you create the habits of walking when there is a red light because by having no cars, then you create the habit of doing so and you will be at cautious, hmm, which could create accidents for both you and the other people.

Person B  1:07  
Yeah, I mean, I think more about efficiency just, because I wouldn't want to wait if there's enough, if I don't see anyone. I think for me, it's like, I might as well because it's just more efficient. But I-I see what you're saying. I guess for general safety that would creep. //

Person A  1:22  
Yeah, I do agree that's more efficient, and like, definitely, there are times when I like want to cross street and I mean, I do, hmm, but like when I think about like, oh, like, do I want my younger sister to be crossing the street? um, there is a red line, there is no cars. Do I want to teach my children in the future. hmm. Just Like, I definitely don't want her I feel like other people wouldn't want to either and I don't want to putting myself or my loved ones or like even like strangers in danger.

Person B  1:51  
Yeah, I guess like I wouldn't tell anyone to just walk whenever they want to, but I personally would, um. Yeah. I don't I don't know..

Person A  2:12  
Yeah, if I ever have to say that, hmm..Do you think this is the case for like all regions? Or like, do you think like, it should be the exception like near schools like primary schools?

Person B  2:28  
Yeah, I think like, if you're crossing near at a school, you probably want to be more careful [Person A: Yeah]. More like in an area where there's like more / or like people who can't make that call themselves. umm. I-I think the reason why I say this is also could, I'm from New York City, and like, no one gives no cares. [Person A: Yeah]. So like, it's just more efficient to do whatever you want. I don't know, it's-it's like the regional habit I guess.

Person A  2:56  
Yeah, I mean, I'm been in city too, umm. I lived in Singapore. umm. But there's like a lot of day walking, a lot of like, some like that, because people are like really busy all the time, like everyone walks really fast and like, generally there's not a lot of problems, but I think like in the grand scheme of things. umm. I would highly recommend people do not cross the street, [laugh], do things the right way. 

Person B  3:23  
Okay.
