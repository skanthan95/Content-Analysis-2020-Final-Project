Person B  0:02  
Yeah, so I think that I-I appreciate the language of should, right, because it implies that it's not being forced. [Person A: Right.] Right, And so I think that the shots are, I mean, important if you don't want to have the flu, right, but especially the language there's a lot of the other statements are more axiomatic. Because it's everyone "should" it means everyone "ought to" right. I think that it's like, that's a fair statement, because it's not {{}}, like, compelling.

Person A  0:24  
Yeah, that's an interesting idea that there's like, as long as there's no outside force, that's compelling people to-to take that specific medical action. that's acceptable. I certainly tend to agree with that. I am actually, specifically the flu shot. So I wouldn't say I would make this argument for almost any other vaccine because most vaccines have really high efficacy rates. The flu shot has a terrible efficacy rate. [Speaker 1: There isn't many strains of it] Yeah, exactly. So it's just a really Yeah, that's a good point. So it's, it's like a it's a really hard uhh vaccine to nail down because it's such an elusive [Speaker 1: Sure] pathogen but it again, it doesn't work very well. So even if you do get it, I think it had like a 30% efficacy rate a few years ago. That's, that's terrible. Like, why get it? 

Person B  1:07  
Sure, sure, relative to 100%? Right. [Person A: yeah] But if we're trying to maximize utility, right, and because flu shots are free, right, if we're maximizing [Person A: yeah, they are free, yeah] free, which they are, right. [Person A: Yeah] even 30% is better than zero percent. Right? [Person A: True.] So we're, if we're, if we're really trying to optimize our lives, right, then getting a flu shot would be something that we'd recommend. But

Person A  1:25  
I think that's true, provided there aren't some downsides to getting the flu shot, [Speaker 1: which are?]  umm there is some there's not some evidence that there's some there's links between getting a vaccine if your immune system is already compromised, and then actually, your immune response being extremely adverse. So [Speaker 1: like? sorry] it's more, okay, so it's more anecdotal. Like, I'm not going to put that out into the universe like it's a statistical fact. [Speaker 1: Sure] But if there are-there are certain anecdotal medical anecdotal instances where someone will get a flu shot when they're already sick. And this could be any vaccine naturally, [Speaker 1: Sure] umm and then they get significantly sick. 

Person B  2:03  
Or can that be because they're already sick [Person A: yes] and time passes and they get more sick?

Person A  2:07  
No, no, [Speaker 1: laughs] like the timeframe is short such that when you actually introduce the-the live strain or the dead strain of the virus and your body's immune response is a little overzealous should we say it's called almost like an auto immune response. And that can really exacerbate your, your medical condition. So there's some scenarios in which actually getting a flu shot, especially if you're already if it's flu season, you're totally it's totally possible that you're sick with something else. You go and get a flu shot. And then you get like, you know, you have a horrible autoimmune response. That's obviously you don't want that to happen to you. 

Person B  2:08  
Sure, but if you're trying optimize your time, you'll be efficacious, wouldn't we? In because that is so anecdotal, right? Should we nonetheless get them to (show?)

Person A  2:50  
just it depends if you want like (youngberry?) syndrome or something like horrible like that.  I don't know that's like, you see, I've definitely seen it. So I'm definitely a person like don't get the flu shot. Like, I don't
