Ok,  so I think like, initially, my response to this was like they shouldn't be fined, partially, I think because it would be a very difficult system to implement. But then also because like I think I was concerned about um like, if people don't have access to recycling bins for whatever reason, like accessibility issues in terms of like getting the recycling to a recycling center, then um when there are lots of reasons why that might not be possible until imposing a fine upon those people would be unfair.

Person A  0:43  
I thought about it like more like the bigger sense. Whereas if we impose a like fine for recycling then maybe businesses will be more likely to give to like not make things out of plastic because they'll be aware that people might not be able to--people won't buy stuff if it, if they could be fined for not recycling it. So then they might like push back and like stop selling things that could be recycled, which could then push back and stop like selling plastic and stuff like that. 

Person B  1:15  
Wait, okay, I'm like, I'm I'm not making the connections, can you explain more? [laughs]

Person A  1:19  
Yeah, no problem. No, I thought it looks like if people would be fined for not recycling--

Person B  1:26  
--Right--

Person A  1:26  
Like a lot of the things that need to be recycled are like plastic and--

Person B  1:30  
--Right--

Person A  1:30  
--and stuff  like that. And so then, because people wouldn't want to have to worry about recycling, they would be less likely to buy things made out of plastic. [Person B: Uh huh]. So then, because they'd be less likely to buy things without plastic, then like the industry would have to adjust to sell us things made in plastic, which then could have like  better implications on the world because less plastic will be mass produced. 

Person B  1:56  
Okay. Yeah, I could say that as like a long term solution. I think like cuz like I think that could work and I think it could also be true that it would be like unfair for some people right? Because like things produced with plastic instead of like, um ceramic or metal are like cheaper, right? So in terms of like communities were like that's going to be more accessible to them financially like imposing fine upon those communities would be unfair. So I think like, I think that would be like could be an outcome but I think overall like it would have to have like mitigating circumstances in terms of like its implementation just in order to be fair to like everyone and like to take into account like various demographics.

Person A  2:35  
Yeah, but like, to be honest, like, usually like governmental solutions are and very, especially under like the recent Trump [person B: mhm] administration aren't very open to like other demographics. So I feel like that could quick-- like what I was talking about could happen like very quickly because--

Person B  2:54  
--yeah--

Person A  2:54  
--people would be so resistant to try and to try to buy plastic things--

Person B  2:59  
--okay--

Person A  3:00  
--Yeah, I think I don't know I probably want to like see more about it. The first thing that comes to mind when I think of this is like the whole like plastic straws soon--

Person B  3:08  
--Yeah--

Person A  3:08  
--which was like I don't I actually don't know how like--
