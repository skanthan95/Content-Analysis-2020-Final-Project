Yeah, um, I-I think uhh if the US lower its drinking age. Uhh I think the for example, people would, you know, attempt to drink more at a younger age, that would probably uh kind of cost more like criminal in a way, for example, um no //. But like for example, I think they probably will lack more self discipline [person A: mhm], for example, drinking  uhh and after drinking came to drive [person A: mhm], or uhh you know, I think, for example, that they will not really think of, like, for example, to come drunk and then they probably need some assistance with uhh, you know, more people [person A: mhm] or things like that, probably not be aware of that. So, uhh that's why I think, you know, have-have a limit for drinking age would kind of uhh, you know, kind of stop those kind of behaviors and uhh would help people to ummm, umm to yeah, to avoid that. And I think there will be probably will have, there'll be a time and age that they can they will be really aware of the sequence (consequence?) of being drunk and what will happen and things like that. And then they can have a free, free free world, you know, free choice. Umm

Person A  2:27  
Yeah, I don't know, I disagree, because uh in a lot of ways, like, people are drinking young anyway. And when it's illegal, you have more of a tendency to binge drink, because you're not drinking in social contexts--

Person B  2:38  
--yeah--

Person A  2:38  
-- like at a restaurant or something like that to go to a party and I went to a university where, you know, we were 18, we were drinking, we were getting drunk, and you're, you're more apt to make bad decisions when it's illegal, and you have to lie about it. Right? [person B: mhm]. So there are people who are lying at age 18--

Person B  2:53  
--yeah--

Person A  2:53  
--about drinking because the drinking age is 21. 

Person B  2:55  
Yeah.

Person A  2:56  
Um and so you're more apt to do all these kind of things that these policies are discussing right in the law doing that kind of thing, because you're going to start drinking young anyway--college is a place where people drink across the world. Um and when I was in the UK and I saw people drinking in college at age 18, it was legal, they were going to pubs, they're walking home, there were procedures in place that they could report if they were having issues, whereas in the US, you know, there's, you know, there's a there's amnesty at the university. But there was still this fear that okay, there's someone who's drunk on my couch, I'm serving a minor, what do I do? Because they're under the age of 21. So just in terms of a lot of issues that I said, I think that we really should lower the drinking age to 18 not lower than that, but that that kind of age where people are generally going in situations where they will be getting drunk.

Person B  3:42  
Hmmm, so so it's 3 minutes and this finish, right?

Person A  3:46  
Yep, I think we're done. That's it [laughs]

Person B  3:48  
Okay.
