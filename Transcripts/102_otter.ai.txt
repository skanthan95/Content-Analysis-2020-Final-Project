Um, I just think that we should always be open to, um, different ideologies. And since the campus is so open with different mindsets and different groups of people with different ideas, I feel like we shouldn't limit it, because you / it or not.

Person A  1:04  
I-I think though that in like a private setting like because the university is like a private institution not like funded by the government or anything, like the students should be able to decide like who they want to hear by and who they don't.

Person B  1:19  
So do you think if there was like first some sort of like survey allowing the students to choose Yes, we would want this person? No, we don't want this person and even if it's someone who has different ideologies from the general college concept or ideals that they could bring someone who has contradicting? because I know sometimes a lot of students are interested in [Person A: uh-huh] listening to other people' s ideologies,  [Person A: uh-huh] even though they're different. So do you think that would be.

Person A  1:48  
I think everyone should have a say. 

Person B  1:50
Should have say before inviting

Person A  1:51
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Because there are some people whose ideologies are like dangerous to like, some people's identities like [Person B: Yeah. mm-hmm. I agree] people who are openly express like racist or like homophobic or like violent viewpoints. And it would make like some students feel unsafe. And I, I think that like everyone should be able to like, feel safe. 

Person B  2:14  
I agree. Yeah. [Person A: Yeah]. I guess it makes sense the, yeah, at least. I guess maybe limiting to people who are not really controversial. And if it's someone who is controversial, so at least give the students a first. [Person A: Yeah.] say [Person A: Yeah] whether they should be invited. [Person A: Yeah] I guess I agree it. [Person A: Yeah] so, umm.

Person A  2:35  
But then that's not like any ideological viewpoint than, any of this. Yeah.

Person B  2:39  
Yeah. I guess some extent. [Person A: Yeah]. It's like any ideological viewpoint. Like I said, the student body is so wide [Person A: Yeah] as it is really you know, there's going to be at least one person at some extreme ideological viewpoint that might align with someone who's really controversial.  [Person A: Yeah] um, and for that person, if you think it's like unfair that they don't get to have a speaker who aligns with their ideas, but I also agree with you because it might be that one person with extreme ideas. [Person A: Yeah] and then who's gonna like affect, a quarter of the students you know? [Person A: Yeah] like essentially, [Person A: Yeah] satisfy a smaller group [Person A: Yeah] versus to the / wise. so I agree to that extent. um [Person A: Yeah]. I guess this question could be like a multi step question, like, given it [Person A: Yeah, because there's like a gradient to. Yeah] to some senes. Yeah, give it some senses. well. 

Person A  3:30  
Yeah. Because even even if there are like some students who want a particular like some extreme students who want like a particular person to come and speak, like, if they still have like, those violent viewpoints as well, [Person B: Yeah] yeah, it's still it was still like, not
