I think that the US, I answered that the US should lower it. Um not too strongly but just moderately I agree with the statement is because um..I'm so I'm from Korea and drinking age  in Korea is 19. And so I was.. I guess I was shocked when I came to the US. I thought it was 21. 

Person A  1:05  
OK--

Person B  1:05  
And I-I well, the reason is I noticed that people drink anyway, you know, 

Person A  1:09  
Sure--

Person B  1:10  
They don't really um like in high schools and stuff. If if theoretically, we were to to lower it, I felt like it wasn't really change anything.

Person A  1:18  
Mhmm

Person B  1:20  
So I think that's why I moderately agreed with this statement [laughs]

Person A  1:25  
Personally I thought that like, although like we're on a college campus, like um drinking it very like it's like what like what you said drinking is very um, like we think it's like happening a lot right? Because it's like, just like fraternities and sororities that  have events where it's people like, like drink right? But like, I-I think like, like, like that's not necessarily true because like I still like me personally. Like I know a lot of people who like don't do it just because it's the law too, 

Person B  1:54  
Yea--

Person A  1:54  
So like if the law isn't there like like like whether people who are religious or whether people who are like, I don't we just don't we just like, we don't want to like, like I don't know, how do you say this? Like, go against the law or something? But like, if you lower it, like, like how much lower would you want it to be like 19? Like, like, uhh--

Person B  2:18  
Sure, like 19 could be fine I guess..and I-I- get, I unders--ike,

Person A  2:23  
I just feel like--

Person B  2:24  
Yeah--

Person A  2:24  
--People have that like conception of like, oh, if you're in college you're gonna drink? Well, I don't think that's true. I-I, it's partially true, but I don't think that's like, that statement could be generalized for the entire populationof college students. 

Person B  2:38  
I guess the reason maybe that I feel like, perhaps this is not the right approach is if you if the intention on maybe having a higher drinking age is to prevent um, you know, reckless behavior, or, I don't know, reckless behavior among teenagers when they drink. I feel like my a more um effective approach would be like to educate. Do more education about how to drink safely rather than imposing it--

Person A  3:10  
Yeah, definitely

Person B  3:13  
--As a law, um so, yeah,

Person A  3:17  
Alright we're almost there. 

Person B  3:18  
Yeah, it works. I mean, 

Person A  3:20  
Yeah, cuz like I'm from China and um, I went back like with my family of years ago. And like I was of age in China. 

Person B  3:27  
Yeah.

Person A  3:28  
But like, I don't it--it still felt weird to me because like, I usually don't drink. [Person B: mhm] So like the fact that I was still legal but then like I live here, so I felt--
