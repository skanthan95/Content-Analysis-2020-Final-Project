Person A  0:35  
Uh. Should implys that it is a right. [Person B: Yeah]. And since they don't own the home or own the room or the doors or anything--it's the land-owning person--

Person B  0:43  
Right, 100%

Person A  0:44  
Uhh of course, they may ask for one--

Person B  0:48  
Right-- 

Person A  0:49  
But um should implies like some sort of right or land owning right or something. 

Person B  0:53  
Yeah--

Person A  0:53  
I guess I. {}{{{{{{{}}}}}}}

Person B  0:55  
I-I agree that a lot of th-th-the question or th-th-the scenarios had like strong words. 

Person A  1:00  
Yeah--

Person B  1:00  
Denoted to them. And so that's why I didn't go all the way on either end, but it felt like um at that age, privacy is more like starts to become more more important than like, if they had said, like, you know, middle schoolers or someone like younger than that, I would have been like, this isn't even a scenario to worry about. But that's why I leaned on the other side of the five--

Person A  1:16  
But do you think locks are relevant to privacy? I mean----Yeah--

Person B  1:20  
--Not not super extreme on that end. That's a good question-- Right--

Person A  1:29  
You can still have privacy without locks, it's about trust and--

Person B  1:32  
Right, no hundred percent. And I think it might be about like how people are raised-- 

Person A  1:37  
Yeah--

Person B  1:37  
--or what they're used to--

Person A  1:38  
--Yeah--

Person B  1:38  
Like, like for bathrooms, a lot of like households don't even have locks on bathrooms. It's like if the door is closed, then you should knock--before entering. Umm do you think that comes from a lack of trust, or--

Person A  1:50  
Umm if it's at a point where someone needs to have a lock, I would say there's just no trust and uh--

Person B  2:01  
--Oooh-- 

Person A  2:01  
--You know..That's--the--yeah, like there's no there's no trust or or or there's no respect for each other's privacy and so a lot kind of, you know, yeah, prevents any uhh--any breaches or any you-you- know, yeah--I don't know. 

Person B  2:18  
Well it's funny because like when I'm back home whenever, like, I'm getting out of the shower going in my room to change. --I will. The first thing I'll do is like, lock my door, right? Close my door--

Person A  2:24  
--Yeah----Sure--

Person B  2:24  
--lock my door, and then I'll change--

Person A  2:28  
--Sure--

Person B  2:29  
 And here when I live with roommates that I don't know as well. 

Person A  2:32  
--Yeah--

Person B  2:32  
 I actually never lock my door. 

Person A  2:33  
That's--and that's and that's a funny--

Person B  2:35  
--Yeah, because I know that they're not even gonna like, like, why would they even come up to my room? Or--

Person A  2:40  
--Sure--

Person B  2:41  
You know what I mean? So it's almost as if, like, I'm, like, more open to leaving my door unlocked--

Person A  2:44  
--Intersting--

Person B  2:45  
--with people that I don't even know. [Person A: Huh] But with my parents--

Person A  2:48  
--Yeah--

Person B  2:49  
--Or just my family--

Person A  2:50  
--Yeah, yeah, maybe--they care too much, so to speak?

Person B  2:54  
I don't know ma-maybe because yeah, maybe like, I mean, we're taught to knock on doors, but maybe I haven't feeling like oh--someone's just gonna like barge in or something--

Person A  3:01  
--Sure, yeah--

Person B  3:03  
It's like weird and I don't know if it's a trust thing--

Person A  3:05  
--No--

Person B  3:05  
 --Or if it's just how I was raised.
