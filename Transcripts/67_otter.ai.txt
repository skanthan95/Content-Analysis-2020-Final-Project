Person B  0:55  
I think I should have a type a five because I think it depends because most of the time, I think it is polite if we don't use phones when we're traveling with our friends or families, but there are some emergency like, you have some urgent situations, you gotta use your phone otherwise people might not come back //// uh their uh contact with you. So I think that it dependends, that's why I gave it a five or six.

Person A  1:25  
I actually completely agree with you umm about, like, what you know what if there's an emergency then like, I don't think it's right to say that you should never be allowed to be on your phone because like, emergency politeness, umm I also do really agree with you that it's not polite to be on your phone umm when you're having dinner with like your friends or your family, and you should try not to [laughs] [person B: laughs] but I think like the reason I gave it like a zero like strongly disagree was actually just because they said never.

Person B  1:55  
Yeah, that's true, absolutely 

Person A  1:56  
Yeah, I think we think exactly alike here [laughs] [person B: laughs]. Um I- I rejected the statement completely because like I of the absolute but like, if they said just when dining with friends or family, people shouldn't text on their phones, umm I would have said no too, like, you know [person A and person B: laughs], don't if it's avoidable. It's it's sort of rude, but and then if you have something really important, then like your friends and family will understand. 

Person B  2:24  
Yeah, I think the number we give depends on like the //, if they use some words like never or absolutely then we, you might choose zero or 10 we tend to, like strongly disagree just --for the question. Yeah

Person A  2:40  
--right. Yeah. No, I mean I think that way too umm [laughs] [person B: laughs] yeah. And it's like, I don't I know, I feel more like, ambivalent about if it's not an emergency, it's like, I think you shouldn't, but like, I don't think it's the end of the world [person B: laughs] . Like, if you're just like really casually, just like I don't know eating  like take out with your friends or something--

Person B  3:02  
--yeah-- 

Person A  3:02  
--and you're all like chilling on the couch? That's different than if you're like having a sit down meal.

Person B  3:06  
Yeah, that really depends yeah.

Person A  3:08  
I know yeah, so it's like, I feel like we basically agree [person A and person B: laughs]. Umm but it's just like, this never is--

Person B  3:16  
Yeah, too absolute.

Person A  3:17  
Too absolute, yeah.

Person B  3:19  
I think if they choose to say like, should, sometimes I might give it a 10 or yeah.

Person A  3:26  
Yeah, should sometimes feel sometimes it's okay. I wouldn't given that a 10 too. Yeah, [person B: laughs] I   would have been like, absolutely that's, that's the way life is [laughs]. Like, sometimes things are okay, sometimes you shouldn't like [laughs] [person B: laughs] 

Person B  3:38  
Yeah. [laughs].

Person A  3:40  
That's funny that this was like a polarizing question. 

Person B  3:43  
Yeah. 

Person A  3:43  
But it might just be because the word never and like how people like want to interpret that and like respond to it versus like the whole idea of like texting at the dinner table [laughs] [person B: laughs].
