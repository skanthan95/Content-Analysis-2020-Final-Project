Okay, sure. Alright, so the reason is, I don't have a personal attachment to that. And I felt like it was something that when there was egregious, taking of life.. I was not..I couldn't / on that with the condition that that that person's life should be spared. And yet, I'm a Christian.

Person A  0:57  
Right.

Person B  0:58  
At the same time--That's the big, that's the big pull.  That's, that's my one issue [person A: mhm]. I don't know if it's--I think it's probably something in the recent news [person A: mhm]--

Person A  1:12  
I See. 

Person B  1:13  
--that, that was umm or was perhaps, was probably my witnessing of um warfare or war movies [person A: mhm]  umm to where I think I made it more.. I think that probably influenced my decision to--

Person A  1:37  
I understand-- 

Person B  1:37  
--more, saying, you know, there's got to be some case [person A: mhm] umm  and I think maybe it's you know, the John Wayne Gacy or umm uhh who was it? Umm the guy--

Person A  1:49  
Bundy? 

Person B  1:52  
Bundy, yeah--

Person A  1:54  
uhh-huh. {{{{{{{{{{{{{}}

Person B  1:54  
--So, I thought right Bundy uhh. There's a great example. I mean, you don't want--I just don't want to take away that possibility. 

Person A  2:04  
Right.

Person B  2:05  
But how do you quantify somebody like that?

Person A  2:09

Person B  2:37  
--yeah--

Person A  2:37

 --and I appreciate you bringing that up--

Person B  2:40  
--yep-- 

Person A  2:41

Person A  2:51  
Mhm and also just like the materials in general, uhh also the lethal injection process  that we use right now--
