So parents should never use iPads as a choice for their toddlers. hmm. I stated that as is, I strongly disagree just because I feel like I know a lot of parents who are able to use iPods, iPads in a way that is effective for their children. So they're teaching them technology literacy, they're ensuring that they're on safety sites. So there's a blessed risk for them, doing things on the internet that they shouldn't do with toddlers like just Watching TV for hours and hours on them or something like that, [Person A: mm-hmm] hmm, So that's my perspective coming into it. I also feel like there's a lot of / and technology for children, which I don't necessarily agree with. And that's part of the reason why I have such a strong disagreement that feels more like a...nine month year old little brother, [Person A: mm] and he saw TV for the first time, hmm, and I was luckily there to see that it was really cute to watch his eyes light up [Person A: mm-hmm]. And my parents who had a very anti technology approach. hmm. I don't necessarily agree with that. so I j ust, i just suspect..

I disagree. hmm, I feel like when children are in such a, no, a state where they're really like picking up everything around them where I believe that like tactile, like being able to like touch things and like learn what things are by like physically touching them and then associating it like with the words, [Person B: yeah.] like helps to build like the literacy and well, you know, I just I feel like if there is a strong reliance on technology while that is a good thing in the future, I feel like when you're a toddler, you should interact like physically with your environment as much as possible.

I would reply to that, say that there are a lot of apps out there in which they can pass an item. Like, if they were reading the sentence, they could touch their parent and maybe hear their sound alongside the word and that could be really helpful and /.  I don't think that is kind of right.

mm-hmm.The other issue I have is that not everyone has access iPad. [Person B: Yeah], obviously, there's like a high, you know, barrier to entry in order to use one and so like, not everyone will have the advantage of using an iPad? [Person B: so no one should use it?] Not that, no one should use it, but I feel like if all kids or at least toddlers have the opportunity to,  you know, interact with their environment physically [Person B: Yeah]. Then obviously if you have an opportunity to use an iPad, [Person B: mm-hmm], that's great.

Person B  3:06  
And I feel like you do have that opportunity at places like libraries. We have like more of a library that for kids this age and it was aimed for them, like was less distractible than other ones. [Person A: Yeah]. And so that was really helpful for them. And to be honest with you seeing the relief on some parents..
