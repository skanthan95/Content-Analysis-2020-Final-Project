So on average the prefrontal cortex in humans which is responsible for decision-making on things like (\fun), and other potentially risky behaviors is not finished developing in humans until approximately 23 and females and 25 in males. And so drinking is obviously not really a problem for adults, but occasionally you do see risky decision making and so I don't really think we should lower the drinking age lower than it already is. Also, like when they bumped it up from 18, the driving deaths went down. So you see the alternative is to like lower, the lower the drinking age you should lower the driving age.

Person A  1:03  
Okay, so I disagree with like the idea that you need to put like, like the brain chemistry in the context like I understand that like sure people are not having their prefrontal cortex fully developed, but like still at 21 that's below the age [Person B: yeah] in which people develop the prefrontal cortexes and like many teens or like younger people are drinking at a younger age. But then in European countries, like where the drinking age is lower, they actually have a much less than like an alcohol problem. [Person B: mm-hmm] I'm not sure what the statistics are, but there's a lot more [Person B: no, no, no, I'm familiar yeah] binge drinking among the American Americans, right. Umm and so when you run into this, like the idea that oh, we have a set limit at 21 is the age at which you can purchase alcohol and it's not served at home, it's frowned upon to drink then it incentivizes people to drink more when they reach that age 21 and that detrimentally effects people and so I think by lowering the drinking age to something like 18, or even like, umm like allowing for more leniency towards like the drinking age just would be helpful in general

Person B  2:04  
I could hear a strong argument for allowing leniency. And I think it's Wisconsin has some sort of law where they will serve you alcohol at any age [Person B: okay] or in a restaurant if you're with your parents. And I think that sort of leniency, I could definitely see a very good argument for in order to combat the sort of drinking like binge drinking problems you are talking about, [Person B: okay] right if it's sort of stigmatize that people feel like that people just never get exposed to alcohol

Person A  2:25  
Sure I think there's like a difference between [Person B: yeah] like, uhh the governmental involvement with like leniency on like their end [Person B: yeah] versus like a cultural difference as well [Person B: that's true] and I think that like the cultural thing is more important to like, [Person B: yeah] discuss with the problems of binge drinking. And I think like in a world in which or in like in the US in which binge drinking is, is or like drinking it in general has like the cap at 21 [Person B: Yeah] it makes it difficult for somebody younger to get introduced more umm easily into the system of like, what alcohol does to your body, what it feels like and whether or not you like or dislike it. 

Person B  3:00  
I see that but also at the same time, I think because like if the drinking age is low, if we were to say 18, it is a lot easier for a 14 year old pass for 18 than for 21. And I think on the one hand like yes, there is a benefit to allowing people to be introduced to alcohol younger. I also think it will be easier for people to acquire alchohol younger and that's not necessarily a good thing. 

Person A  3:18  
I disagree. I think like the age between 14 to 18 [Person B: mm-hmm] like the the appearance of somebody is like drastically different than between like 18 and 21 [Person B: that's true] And so if if like the drinking age is 18 we're not going to have like the problem
