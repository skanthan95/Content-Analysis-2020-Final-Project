Why is that? Umm I think there are some crimes that this is appropriate umm punishment and deterrence.

Person A  0:44  
Okay. I appreciate that you think some crimes might deserve that level of retribution. [Person B: mm-hmm] I can see your perspective there. But that isn't actually what happens in the US right. [Person B: mm-hmm] When people try to apply the death penalty in the US they have a hard time getting the drugs. The drugs sometimes don't work, [Person B: : mm-hmm] and appeals can go on and [Speaker 1: mm-hmm]  the average person on death row stays on death row for 40 years or more [Person B: : mm-hmm].

Person B  1:07  
And I think that would be a case for improving the execution of it, but not the case for like, let's just get rid of it. Because if they don't do it, well, we shouldn't try to do it. It's something is something we should do, we should try to do it better. And not just give up because we can't do it well.

Person A  1:26  
Okay, I can appreciate wanting to carry it out in a way that is more feasible. But even with that, I think it's impossible to really know for absolute certain [Person B: mm-hmm] that the people are guilty of what we think they're guilty of, [Person B: mm-hmm] like hundreds of people are exonerated from death row every year because they're actually innocent of the crimes [Person B: mm-hmm] that they were accused on.

Person B  1:46  
Hmmm. Yeah, but that should be something that the legal system does, right. The fact that they are exonerated it shows that the system is working. You know, says that if people think they should Not be given the death penalty, they're not given the death penalty and so we can //probably right// I don't think is a valid argument for we should not do it we should improve //probably targeted(?)//. So another thing that I have against like abolishing it is that so if you keep the those people in the prison that forever It's a huge cost first for the taxpayers and also for for some people like the the victims and the families of the victims. It's a culture for the for the rest of their life knowing that those people are just going to stay alive, stay there and be given food and be given protection, be given safety and some of them they published books telling us, "Oh, how many people I killed!" And I just think that there should be something there for them. That is not a guarantee of the rest of their life.

Person A  2:51  
Okay. I definitely am glad that you brought up you know, the victims and their family [Person B: mm-hmm]. Oftentimes, with the way it doesn't work now with the appeals process and what that sort of big putting someone's family for [abrupt ending]
