Um, we're supposed to discuss we had a bearing of opinions, I'm assuming, um, I actually said that it's okay. I was more of a agreeing that we should allow [laughs] speakers with any ideological, but not extremely, but not neutral, so I'm in the middle of that [laughs]

Person A  0:27  
Yeah, um I disagreed with this prompt strongly because um I think it's dangerous to give platforms to uhh hateful and extremist viewpoints, um especially on university campuses where there are a lot of influentially young people, I think it can give rise to widespread, uh hateful rhetoric um at a place where people are supposed to feel safe.

Person B  0:55  
Um I can see your point on that, totally. But, I mean trying to also make sure that we have all the viewpoints of not that I necessarily adhere to those. But, of course, for me, it's this invited speaker--right the invited speaker if it if it kind of propels thought in either--not necessarily I don't want to promote hate either. But I do want to say how do we--how do we think about because the world does have all of these views and figure out so that's why I was not strongly agree with it, but I was--I didn't want to be quite neutral. And I // [laughs] right? I mean, right it's like how do you balance everything?

Person A  1:39  
Umm I think the point about um the speakers being invited is uhh not something that we should focus on. Because we don't know who's doing the inviting. Umm and it's uhh if it's not, it could be the university. It could be one person at the university inviting these speakers um to-to promote their own viewpoints. But um the-the  I think we should focus on the viewpoint that the speaker is going to talk about, and whether that is something that is dangerous, that has historically proven itself to be something that gives rise to issues, um especially in like, involving hate or involving anything that um can make someone feel unsafe. Yeah.

Person B  2:51  
I mean, I, I can I can totally see that. I mean, I just came from a doing a group for kids um who are--live in Inglewood who constantly are under pressure, you know, drugs and so drugs--
