I feel like where you come from in terms of your race and ethnicity, shouldn't really have much to do with like, your level of education and like your intelligence, [person A: uh-uh] so, I don't think it's like necessary to kind of have that information. I mean, I get some schools like use it for like diversity reports and all that stuff [person B: mhm]. But in terms of like, actually, admission, it's not important to me at least.

Person A  0:59  
Um I appreciate what you said about that, uhh about kind of having like a blind-- kind of like an almost like an equal opportunity for like, it's just like we're purely looking at like knowledge--

Person B  1:12  
--yeah--

Person A  1:12  
--and like not race. I thought about that--and then I also like start wanting to consider like affirmative action like [person B: mmm], like do I agree with affirmative action? I think it got me into this school [laughs]. But also like I don't know, I just think like, to a certain extent, race does affect the level of..how somebody can like kind of go through their day to day life. 

Person B  1:40  
Yeah.

Person A  1:40  
And that does carry out into like, how education works. And like, your ability to like, have a certain level of education can like be hindered by where you are in like your social class and also like that also is affected by like your race to a certain extent--

Person B  2:01  
Yeah.

Person A  2:01  
 --so, that's why I thought they should be like, they shouldn't be completely blind to it--

Person B  2:05  
--yeah--

Person A  2:05  
--but it shouldn't be like this big factor. 

Person B  2:07  
Yeah, yeah. Well, I totally agree with that. Like, because based on race, it's like some areas have  disproportionate amounts of education or like, quality of education. 

Person A  2:16  
Yeah. 

Person B  2:17  
So I totally get that. I don't know. I just know it's a tough question. Okay. I don't know, me personally, I, I just normally wouldn't really care. But at the same time, I see how like, people are affected by that. 

Person A  2:35  
Yeah [laughs] uhh--

Person B  2:40  
I'm sorry-- I totally like went to a school where everyone was everyone there was like-- Oh, they didn't really teach us much like, like, but like it's also taking your own initiative. Umm because a lot of times, I felt like // if I didn't understand what was going on the class, I would do stuff  outside of class to kind of get up. So 

Person A  2:40  
Yea, you ca--go--[laughs] Yeah, like I- so what you're saying is like, there's always just like the opportunity, like--we have like the opportunity to always learn more, even if like we happen to get like a bad set of cards. 

Person B  3:06  
--sure--Yeah

Person A  3:13  
Umm, so yeah, but also like, in turn, like, if you were dealt a bad set of cards that should be considered--

Person B  3:23  
--yeah--

Person A  3:23  
--like something that should be considered. So like, even if like, you came from like a public school, and like a really like, poor community like that should like and you did like amazingly well and you're absolutely
