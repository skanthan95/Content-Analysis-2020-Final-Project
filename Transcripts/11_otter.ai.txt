I just strongly believe in the right to um {{}} dignity. And so yeah, I agree with with the idea that physician assisted suicide should be legal. Um I think it's important that like, I don't know, from personal experience like seeing people who are like suffering when they're like in old age and like dying to know that they should be allowed to do something. 

Person B  0:30  
I like what you said about like the right to. I just think, um I guess I was looking more towards like younger people. I think of older like hospice, I wasn't thinking about. But I feel like as much as it helps them-- it also encourages it. I don't know. 

Person A  0:47  
That makes sense. Yea, it's like normalizing the idea of like suicide. Which, yeah, I guess some people might not see it as a last resort anymore. They might just treat it as like something that they could do-- just go out and like run to Walgreens [laugh]. 

Person B  0:59  
[laugh] Yeah, no I agree with what you said about like normalizing because I think like people will see what physicians and doctors do and clinics as just like, they're like authority they have like PhDs and whatever. So whatever they encourage and they offer services to, is things that people are going to think are like...super...acceptable and not just like, you can walk in and get this as easy as you could do something like get a surgery if you need it or something.

Person A  1:28  
Yeah, like I think personally, I just was imagining it being like a really regulated process, um where you have to, like still demonstrate like you like that this is the last resort. Um and also because like yeah, like I know that there's like a lot of potential for abuse. Like if you just like, like if you convince your significant other-- like that one {{}} [laugh]. Do you know what I'm talking about? 

Person B  1:45  
[laugh] I don't know 

Person A  1:46  
Well OK like this guy..like this chick convinced her boyfriend to like off himself. 

Person B  1:50  
What?

Person A  1:51  
And I feel like yeah, there's just a lot of potential for abuse because it becomes this easy and like painless, then there there might be an issue, which is I think there needs to be a lot of layers of regulation. Um but yeah, something that I feel like um kind of has a lot of like it actually they have this not like several other countries and mostly people who like ah look at the prescription for example like don't necessarily won't even use it um they'll just like feel better having it there. 

Person B  2:13  
So I like we said about regulation but, I'm confused about like having it there I feel like that's so much worse if you're like going about your life and you just have this like I can off myself kind of slip going on. And I don't know how it would get like regulated because you like on your worst days you go in and be like I want this slip. But then on better days, you might like reconsider it.

Person A  2:34  
I think like most people, for most people it might be like a just kind of a um.. like I think it just it would still be like kind of a last resort like like as in like like you would just like a lot of people at least from anecdotally like they take comfort in having the like the option..um but then, like they just feel more secure with their {{}}.. 

Person B  2:55  
Yeah, so I agree with like having options, but how would you make sure that people like see this option as like less available than like therapy and counseling and like..?

Person A  3:05  
Oh, yeah, so, I think it would have to be mandated {{}}.
