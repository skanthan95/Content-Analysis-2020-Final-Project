Sure, so uh understoodly I disagree with the statement that college students should be required to volunteer. Uh I don't exactly remember which exact number but I, I do disagree [person A: mhm], because from my personal experience in my I, I go to high school in Shanghai [person A: mmm], and there has been a reform in which it requires every single high school student in Shanghai to kinda to community volunteer [person A: hmm], and I don't think that's reform turned out there well [person A: hmm], so everyone cuz they're like, something around like 10,000 uhh no, actually, around like 7-70 thousand uh high schools in Shanghai and there are actually not so ma-much need [laughs] [person B: laughs] for community service [person A: hmm]. [person B: laughs] And so a lot of the time people are just wasting time from their [person A: hmm] actual volunteer and like, watching the clocks hoping this is over, and things like that. And I feel like it like it has like completely uhh lost, like the original intention of of what the government wants high school students to do if it's a constant requirement, like people no longer consider like, why they want to do this. So that's what what I'm thinking.

Person A  1:41  
Hm, yeah, I-I definitely haven't thought about--like that's a good point that that like if it's mandatory, maybe you like it becomes kind of pointless [person B: laughs]. Um I guess I just I just think it's a good way for people like it wouldn't occur to a lot of people. Maybe that's more here in America like to volunteer.  So I think, it's a a good way to encourage it by making it mandatory [person B: mhm]. And I think it does let people like, uh discover stuff that they might be passionate about that they might might not realize, through like service to the community.So that's why I think it's a good idea. And I think, you know, nobody wants to volunteer probably [laughs] [person B: laughs]. But I would say that's why I guess I did say 10, so [laughs] [person B: laughs] I feel like I-I did this in um in high school. We also had a requirement [person B: mhm] that we had to volunteer in the community. And I did, I stuffed a lot of envelopes with letters uhh, but uh like overall, I thought it was it was pretty valuable. Like I definitely don't regret it. So, I think--

Person B  2:50  
Yes, it's probably because it's a smaller community or something [person A: mhm] that it doesn't work out very well it always so many high school student [laughs].

Person A  2:59  
Right, yeah, yeah, I guess that that would be really different. Do you-- I mean like do you feel like there's like any benefit to it like--

Person B  3:07  
Um initially--
