Person B  0:07  
Okay, so I believe I was against this, that must mean that you-- I like I just totally think it takes you out of the situation and therefore--

Person A  0:11  
Oh, I thought I was also--should never be allowed to text on their phones. I misread the question actually--Oh, yeah, no--I actually really significantly. I feel that people should be able to text on their phones at any meal. I don't have any problem. 

Person B  0:29  
Okay, okay. 

Person A  0:30  
So I did miss-read, yeah, I my stance on it is if someone is over using their technology, that's a very different thing. But I very much feel like if something comes up, and someone needs to text on their phone or they get a message from somebody that can be shared with the family. It feels like it's reducing, I guess--

Person B  0:50  
Sorry, say that again--

Person A  0:51  
Like, it feels like if we can't use our phones in those situations, you're sort of making it so that there's less interaction with your friends and family.

Person B  1:01  
I mean, I guess there's a difference between never being allowed, like, do I actually have any rules anymore? I'm an adult as an--

Person A  1:11  
--Yeah-- 

Person B  1:12  
Like, some--my parents are calling me and I need to tell them--

Person A  1:15  
--Yeah--

Person B  1:15  
--I'm at dinner. I'll call you back unless it's really urgent. 

Person A  1:18  
Yeah.

Person B  1:19  
 Or you're sitting here and there's a lull in the conversation. I pull out the phone because--

Person A  1:24  
--Yeah--

Person B  1:24  
--guess what happens? And I think when you don't have a general preference of not doing that, it's very easy to fall into that--

Person A  1:32  
It really is and I think it also too depends on like, how some of like personal relationships work because the majority of my friends and family are people who I know online, I wouldn't want to not be able to talk to them if I'm having dinner with my friends who they're also friends. 

Person B  1:48  
Yes, yes, that's fair umm--

Person A  1:50  
--But then it's like it's actually part of the circle conversation of being able to say, oh, person A says something--

Person B  1:56  
I mean, I think the--Yeah, I mean, texting.. Texting is bringing more people into the conversation.

Person A  2:03  
Yeah 

Person B  2:03  
Uh, one thing I really dislike is like people looking things up on their phone during a conversation. 

Person A  2:08  
Really? I'm curious why? 

Person B  2:09  
Because I think it it changes the power dynamics of a conversation, if somebody-- if one person is always like fact checking everything that everybody is saying--

Person A  2:21  
So, you don't mean--sorry-- so in terms of like checking something to prove if someone is right, versus someone says something that they don't know a lot about, and they look up to find out more about it? 

Person B  2:32  
Yeah, yeah, I mean, but those can easily bleed into being the same thing. 

Person A  2:36  
I've never really run into it becoming the other thing. Uh I-I had not thought about that idea, though. I guess I'm I'm a teacher. So whenever anybody says something I'm not familiar with the very first thing I do is go Google it. So--

Person B  2:51  
Yeah, I mean, I think I think it's interesting, right? Like, how it that it's a relatively new phenomenon.

Person A  2:57  
It's an extremely new phenomena. I don't know how familiar with you are with like, text encyclopedias, but trying to go get a text and frankly, you--
