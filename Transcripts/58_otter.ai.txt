So I'm from a culture where, like a country where capital punishment, like people are used to capit- uh uh, capti- punis- ... capital punishment. So I guess I'm just kind of used to the fact that it is something that we can do.

So I appreciate that you bring up that there are like different perspectives, especially by country (in specific?). I think when I was answering the question, this is something that comes up a lot in like elementary school education as a debate topic. And when we do, like, basic preliminary research on it, a lot of what we saw was that it's not always successful. And so there are a lot of attempts that sometimes have to be made, which turns out to be an expensive process. Well that was one of the (main?) reasons I I answered the way I did.

Person B  1:10  
Ya.. I thought they were just like use things (then set data?) to (prove?) that whether capital punishment, um, should be abolished. But I think, um, could you elaborate more on the research that you mentioned.

Person A  1:29  
Yeah, so, um, thank you for asking. And I'd like to clarify first that to something I haven't seen, like, this is a question I haven't answered since maybe sixth grade. But, um, well and the projects that we did way back when, uh, it was I think we were mostly looking at single interaction. As one that wasn't always successful. It had like a 93% success rate or something. And so that 7% of the time, we were looking at it in terms of it being, like I said, an expensive process that required like the entire procedure of bringing in additional people to officiate it and also that, um, could ultimately be cruel to the person if it was not successful...

Person B  2:15  
I guess, uh, one of the reasons that I would agree not to abolish capital punishment is because, um, people would be how emotionally satisfied with the result if the people who committed the crime is punished in a way.. like, it's like an eye for an eye. So if someone kills another person, then maybe it should like this person actually deserve the same punishment. Yeah.

Person A  2:52  
Thanks for bringing that up. I really hadn't looked at it that way before in terms of the family, or whoever it was feeling a sense of, uh, I guess closure...
