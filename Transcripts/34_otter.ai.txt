I mean I don't think I know like enough about it. Like I haven't researched the topic enough for me to choose my /(opinion ?) too /(strong ?). Yeah. Like, I haven't heard the argument. Like I guess the argument with the other side would be these people are bad enough that they should not be alive anymore but I also like recognize that it shouldn't be the job of the state to like actually hurt people. But I haven't like looked into anymore so I don't know either. What about you?

Okay, so the reason why I am strongly in fav-, there's two reasons why I'm strongly in favor of abolishing the death penalty. One is that it just costs more money in this country to kill someone [Person B: that's true], than they keep them alive as messed up as that sounds, because as you have to go through so many logistical hurdles in order to actually put someone in order to condemn someone to death in this country [Person B: mm-hmm], that it will be just cheaper paying for someone to spend the rest of her life in prison. No, lawyers aren't cheap [Person B: that's true]. But the primary reason why I'm strongly in favor of [abolishing] the death penalty is because of-of the number of people who have been exonerated in the last as 40 or so years, thanks to DNA evidence. And I just think, wow, these are the people we were lucky enough to catch before they were executed. So how many innocent people were there that were executed before we had DNA-A to exonerate them. I don't feel-feel confident in our ability to catch the right person 100% of the time and I'd much rather let completely irreprehensible people spend the rest of their lives behind prison, than risk killing someone who is innocent of the crimes that they are accused of .

That's true. I see your point and I definitely like I mean, I haven't thought of it from that perspective. But like, again, it makes sense another facet it might add like when I'm forming my opinion, I think it just will strengthen it versus making me more ambivalent umm..

Person A  2:50  
like, your um-apprehension in terms of not being in strongly either way, considering you feel like you're not that important does make a lot of sense.

Person B  3:02  
Yeah, like I don't want to say that I'm-
