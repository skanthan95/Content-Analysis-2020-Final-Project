umm, why I disagree was because I feel like if things should be tested it might as well be tested on animals first before a human being. because even with like in the medical field, in fact / on every thing is always been tested on animals first before humans just to reduce the mortality rate [Person A: hmm] for humans wear. so why did you agree?

Person A  1:09  
Yeah, I think that your points are really interesting but [Person B: yeah], for me, um, what made me agree with this was I think that though, genetically they are like differences between animals and humans.[Person B: oh] So like, even if you do test products on animals, [Person B: Yeah] it can't guarantee like [Person B: that makes sense] that you get a result that [Person B: Yeah], we'll apply the same to human. [Person B: Right] um, So that was my main reason for this [Person B: right, for disagree], not for this, I agree. I agree with that.

Person B  1:41  
Okay, so are you saying that you should be tested on humans, if it might as well be used on humans.  

Person A  1:49  
oh, can you repeat that /? [laugh]

Person B  1:50  
Oh, are you saying that, are you saying that. so products if you want if if the product is supposed to be created for humans, it should be tested on human beings at once, rather than testing on animals.

Person A  2:00  
I um, I think that, like, above, and now they're like concerns about mortality rate, but. [Person B: yeah] I think like, if it were to be tested on humans maybe in like a safer environment, [Person B: oh], I think that, um, you will get better result, [Person B: really],  on the / of the product, if you did test on human first then animals. but I'm not like explicitly saying that you should test on human. Yeah. 

Person B  2:30  
Test on human. that makes sense. But then again, if you tested on human, what age group would you test people, [Person A: Yeah, that's] we tested it on children, all people, middle class. [laugh] who are you going to test on? No one is going to be tested on. 

Person A  2:45  
Yeah, that's so. Yeah. [Laugh]

Person B  2:50  
That' s so funny. I just popped in like, what age group would you test people.

Person A  2:54  
Yeah, I think like hearing you say that. [Person B: Yes] Really interesting like, yeah, it's like [Person B: laugh] it's, yeah, it's a difficult question.

Person B  3:03  
It is very interesting, [Person A: yeah] because, I'm just like, huh, it's always animals usually be like rats guinea pig or like so many animals. because like even when you want to do vaccines, it always goes to animal. But it would be pretty interesting like testing on humans first. the only Funny thing is just who would you test people. [Person A: laugh] because the old people the immune system is less, the children the immune system is less, so we, you and I age group but none of us want to. [Person A: Yeah, yeah, that's] [laugh] 

Person A  3:31  
um, that's interesting. I think, maybe, like, I was thinking like, why, I guess like.
