Person B  0:18  
Oh, okay, um, so I felt like uh--I feel like I ranked pretty high in terms of like, never I-I think I don't know how you would enforce a never--

Person A  0:30  
--[laughs] Yeah--

Person B  0:31  
--talk on the phone--like I don't know how to enforce that but I do think like people who like have conversation  shouldn't talk on the phone, while they're having a conversation. I think that's disrespectful. Umm I think last--yesterday even, when I went to like a seminar and like the woman who was holding the seminar at a certain point, like, pulled out her phone--

Person A  0:49  
Sorry, I can't hear--Yeah, yeah go ahead [laughs].

Person B  0:50  
Oh, okay--So one of women on a seminar like who was holding a seminar, like, pulled out her phone in the middle of the seminar and just started like, I knew it was like urgent. But she didn't even like tell anyone, so this guy was just like talking and she was just like on her phone--

Person A  1:03  
Wh-what's a seminar? I'm sorry, can you just--

Person B  1:04  
It was um it was like Jane /. It was about, about conservatism. 

Person A  1:08  
Or, um I guess when you say seminar do you mean like a a discussion?

Person B  1:13  
Yeah it was a discussion, it was like a..it's around a table. And um it was just like a, probably around like 10 people there. And she was kind of leading the discussion. And then she was asking people questions [person A: mhm]. And um some guy, a guy started talking. And um.. so he started talking and as he was talking, she, like, pulled out her phone because I think she got //. But she didn't like look up at him and was like, wait, hold up. So as he was talking to students, she was just going like this--uh-uh. And then just like kept, and so it was just kind of like, it put me off.

Person A  1:44  
--Yeah--

Person B  1:44  
I don't know about you.

Person A  1:45  
I-I would agree that I think that that situation is rude actually. Um, the thing I disagree with is that people should never be allowed to be on their phones and text. Um I am a big proponent of people, you know, family dinners and big events being times to focus on your family and, and be present with them. Um but I do think there's exceptions to that. Um I mean, there's cases where people have things that they need to check--uh things in their life that are important. And there are also times when if you're in situations that are uhh very social, and maybe it's a group and things that take a long time and sometimes people leave alone to sort of, you know collect their thoughts and be with themselves for a second [person B: mhm]. So I guess the part I disagree with is the never part. 

Person B  1:46  
Yeah--

Person A  1:46  
Not necessarily that people should be in the moment and be present with things that are going on.

Person B  2:39  
Yeah, I do feel like in that way we kind of align. I-I also do think that like, there are moments where like, you might have something going on in your life and you're like, unable or like even if it means like texting like I know, um yesterday, like my professor was--this is not like a family dinner, but like he was talking and I was just like  on my phone like, waiting to see my grade for something.

Person A  3:03  
Yeah--

Person B  3:03  
I was like scared you know, like, I think like, I feel like there's all these people are like wait, like, I don't I don't know if I think that people should have their phones with them, like next to them, or if it's just like I have--
