Oh wow--Okay, well, I give it an eight so..I mean like in some cases when I'm really in hurry-- someone's really in hurry I think they should be able to cross and there's like absolutely no cars inside, but in general, but in general..I don't think people should do that.

Person B  0:38  
Okay I see where you're coming, but from in terms of like if you were a driver, I guess I don't really get like if there's no cars there..Why can't you cross? Like why wouldn't you do that?

Person A  0:48  
Um because maybe a car will be coming very fast..or they like but they can't like break like if they see you crossing--like especially walking and they couldn't break in time and it might cause an accident or if everyone does that, it's going to be quite chaotic on the street but--

Person B  1:14  
I definitely think that, yea--

Person A  1:15  
And that's my reason--

Person B  1:16  
I can see how like it could stop the cars from like breaking in time. But I feel like if you don't see a car like anywhere and it's like people are distant, you should be able to cross even if someone was going say like 80--70,  and also they shouldn't really be going that fast in the first place if it's a local street because you're able to cross--unless it's a highways which wouldn't have crosswalks--plus I just feel like they shouldn't be going that fast anyways, and so it wouldn't be dangerous--especially if you didn't see anything down the line. 

Person A  1:43  
Yeah, that may makes sense before. I mean there's absolutely no cars that are in sight then I think you can cross if you're in a hurry [laughs].  

Person B  1:53  
Yeah, I think  also just, I guess, I guess I would describe it like even if you're not in a hurry--you should do it. Like what's the point of waiting if there's no one there to like for you to wait?

Person A  2:04  
Um, okay [laughs].

Person B  2:08  
I don't know, that's how I see it

Person A  2:10  
I see I see. Yeah, I just think there's a..I don't know a  certain rules like if you were--I'm a ..I tend to follow them sometimes.

Person B  2:24  
Yea, but I guess, ya I see sometimes I do want to improve and  I think especially in Chicago, a lot of people go kind of like jaywalk--I always hate it when people do that.

Person A  2:32  
Yea, yea, driver's radio I hate that and I think that if people just came out of nowhere it could be dangerous for them.

Person B  2:43  
My only concern is that if the concern is  that they can't stop in time and it's dangerous, even if they're going that fast and /(they see a red light?)/ Sometimes, because they're going that fast, they can't stop /(even for a red light?)/

Person A  2:54  
Even with the red light, they won't stop freely.
