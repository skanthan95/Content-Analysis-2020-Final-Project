So I guess for this I'm I was one indicating strongly disagree-- is that right? [person A: mhm] Yeah, and um  so I guess I also like kind of could have gone I I don't know about either way I think this is quite polarizing for me because like so when talking about the death penalty, like people who commit like very heinous a crimes, let's say [person A: mhm], um I think there should be a large penalty. But I personally don't know if I think that we, and by we I don't know if I'm speaking as like humans or myself should be able to, like say this person doesn't deserve to live [person A: mhm]. Um and so I think the alternative to the death penalty, my mind was just like, lifetime incarceration. And so I that was kind of what I had in mind when I said, I disagree with killing someone. I don't know what what your process was there but--

Person A  1:29  
I really appreciate you sharing that. I think it's interesting to bring up you know, kind of how people do commit really heinous crimes, and it's like, what's the alternative to keeping them--

Person B  1:40  
--yeah--

Person A  1:40  
--in for life? I think the thing that kind of really swayed me for this issue is that our justice system is just really bad at telling when people have actually committed a crime. 

Person B  1:52  
Okay.

Person A  1:53  
Umm especially with like the racial biases that exists. 

Person B  1:56  
Yeah.

Person A  1:56  
There's been so many innocent people have been on death row. And they usually tend to be African American. Um and I think that's a big one for me. I feel like I'd rather have guilty people spend a lifetime in prison, then innocent people die. If that makes any sense?

Person B  2:15  
Now, I'm thinking I mark this incorrectly. [person A: mhm] Because I-I agree with this. I think the death penalty should be abolished, which wouldn't be a 10 [person A: laughs]. I'm so sorry. 

Person A  2:29  
No, you're good. 

Person B  2:29  
No, I ruined their whole thing? No, but I agree, I think like kind of going off what you said, I'll let them know. But like, that the fact that like, the justice system is also I don't know, there's this like, like, you talked about, like the the inequity there[ person A: mhm] and the, um like, racial profiling. Um and I think some kind of now on the sense that like, we agree here, um--

Person A  2:52  
--yeah--

Person B  2:52  
--I think if if like the system could be improved, and like, people who were, like put in jail over a long period of time on sort of like non like violent crimes umm or  like to be let out I think like a big problem's like mass incarceration is such an issue. Um and I so I guess it's also kind of why I-I don't think that we should like on the one hand I don't like the death penalty um and but on the other hand I think like this incarceration is also like a big issue and so I have ruined their experiment [person A: laughs]. ///

Person A  3:25  
We will.

Person B  3:30  
But mean I-I can like hear like rational arguments for why people think it should not be abolished. Um I mean, I I don't think I would be able to carry--
