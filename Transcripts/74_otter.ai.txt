Person B  0:16  
So I disagreed with this because actually when I was like shoot, when is--is middle school 12?--

Person A  0:24  
Uh, yeah.

Person B  0:25  
Between middle school like elementaryish.

Person A  0:28  
 Yes. 

Person B  0:28  
So I didn't actually have a cell phone until like I was in seventh grade, so about 12 [person A: mhm] but a big issue was that like my--so both of my parents worked um, and I did club like club activities after school [person A: mhm]. Which means that I would miss the bus [laughs]--

Person A  0:44  
--Oh, okay--

Person B  0:44  
--leaving and then so it's really hard to get the contact with my parents without a without a cell phone. That being said, I mean, I interpreted this question as like cell phones in general [person A: uh-uh] as like, a flip phone [person A: ohh] or like like a slide phone, right? Like the really, not a smartphone. Umm--

Person A  1:02  
--okay--

Person B  1:02  
--uhh I think smartphones start to get into a very iffy--

Person A  1:06  
--oh, okay--

Person B  1:07  
--place because it's like, it's kind of at the same the question of like whether children should be allowed to use like iPads as toys. 

Person A  1:14  
Yeah

Person B  1:15  
Like, no that's--

Person A  1:16  
Oh, I get I get what your point here. 

Person B  1:18  
Yeah.

Person A  1:18  
And I kind of agree. If like the situation about like the simple flip phone. 

Person B  1:24  
Yeah

Person A  1:25  
I think that, in that case for children under 12, or 12 year old ish [person B: uh-huh], that might be a necessary tool to just keep them safe. And--

Person B  1:36  
yeah--

Person A  1:36  
--like, as you said, transferring from home to school. But like maybe judging from my own experience, [person B: uh-uh] I only get cellphone like even a very simple one after I entered undergrad.

Person B  1:50  
Oh, wow.

Person A  1:50  
So that was not like a big part of my experience. And if you like use, like old fashioned phone calls more often, but I--

Person B  2:00  
--yeah--

Person A  2:00  
--I know, like, it's a different time and era and children do have different requirements. And the reason why I put nine is because I imagined that as an iPhone or iPad ish phone so like--

Person B  2:15  
--yeah--

Person A  2:15  
--even for an adult like myself, sometimes I devoted too much time just browsing randomly on my phone. So I don't think that's a good thing for children of such a young age like it will also damage their iPad as well--

Person B  2:31  
Yeah, I think uhh--

Person A  2:33  
Cause do you have any like, problem--

Person B  2:36  
--so like--

Person A  2:36  
--when you have--

Person B  2:37  
So when, I-- so like I said, like middle school and elementary schools, was kind of hard to get things going [person A: mhm]. But then up to middle school, I had like a flip phone [person A: mhm] for several years. as like a pass-down [person A: mhm] from like my parents actually. And then like I got like an iPhone [person A: mhm] in ninth grade, I think [person A: mhm]. Uhh and even then though, like my parents were really strict about like, okay, when you're studying you can't your phone [person A: uh-uh, person B: laughs]or like when you go asleep you have to charge your phone in our room [person A: mhm]. And so like, it's still still like very limited but I get what you mean about like being distracted. 

Person A  3:06  
Yeah, like--

Person B  3:06  
Cause I think that's definitely a case with now with like--.
