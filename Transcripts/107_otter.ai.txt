So my opinion on this statement is that if there's no cars in sight, even if you see a red light, you can walk across the street because, you know, there's certain intersections around that don't have red lights, right? And those tend to be in those busier areas where there are a lot of cars. But again, when there's no cars like you look left, you look right, you look left again and they, it's, if there is no cars coming across the street.

Person A  1:00  
All right. um, so, as they said, so I disagree. Because I think that, umm, even if you got into the habit of doing that, uh, you may, if there, if it did become a busy intersection, and then you were in a rush, [Person B: mm-hmm] and then you start to cross the streets, and those cars drive really carelessly, [Person B: Yeah] and you can't see what's coming, and you could be at risk of getting in trouble. 

Person B  1:33  
Yeah, I think you have to be smart about it too. Because like, even just like, pedestrians will be like, looking at their phone, not looking at the road, and sounds like I definitely see the danger of that. But I mean, like, I guess, like, in a distraction for your world, like, even if there's a distracted driver, like, if I see that someone's clearly like, distracted, I'm not gonna cross the street. whereas like, if I know I'm not distracted, and I can like see that there's no cars coming, then I would so across.

Person A  1:59  
Yes, and um, I am trying to. um. But I guess the point to ultimately is, is that if there are rules that for drivers as well, pedestrians could also try to follow the rules, give, given that [Person B: Yeah] I hear the world so that people do avoid getting hurt.

Person B  2:24  
I see what you're saying now because like, like it's like about the law right? [Person A: Yeah. Laugh] I was thinking of it as like, if I need to get from point A to point B and there's no cars like should I do it? Yes. But like in terms of like laws, because I definitely do you feel like people should follow the laws and like they're there for a reason. but, um, I also feel like certain laws are more I don't want to say important but like, [Person A: mm-hmm] they hold more weight than other laws and like. In this situation, I would always say like, sure, but personally season they're fine to go, go but if I was in a car, I would never say like, run a red light, you know? [Person A: mm-hmm] Just because of the differences and I guess like what consequences could possibly come out of that? 

Person A  3:07  
Yeah, exactly. I guess I was thinking about it. It's like you're in a car you're protected. And like unfortunate people who do drive carelessly may have that idea but people pedestrianing are so unprotected, [Person B: mm-hmm] against bicycles and cars. So. {{}} it's like. [laugh] Yeah.
