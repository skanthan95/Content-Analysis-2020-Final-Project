Okay. [Person A: laughs] Wow. So growing up, my dad was an infectious disease doctor, so [Person A: interesting] basically all I've ever known through him [Person A: okay] not only is that how he made his money so it would be [Person A: yeah] a little contradictory for me to not believe in that, [Person A: right] but just through his experience and his belief as a doctor, that's kind of the foundation of what he does umm and yeah [Person A: okay] I'd be more interested to hear your

that's really cool that you share that and in terms of your father being a umm doctor. Umm I had a terrible experience with flu shots so I-I'm in great condition medically. But the one time I had a flu shot, I just remember being terribly sick and feeling like well, dang, I could have just got the flu. I mean, It would have been pretty much the same. Umm my mother also had one and she was so ill to she actually fainted, we had to call an ambulance. This happened about a year ago. Umm and I was like, really, I've never seen my mother like that. So I was like, really shaken up. And I was like, you know, that's flu shot. I don't know if it's, you know, as beneficial as people think it is. [Person B: Uhh-huh] But I'll be really interested to hear more about like, why you think it's [Person B: sure. umm] something that should happen.

 So again, I don't really know the science behind it. But I can hear my dad telling me this. But I think the point of the flu shot that well, it might not explicitly protect you against the flu, it might even in some cases cause you to have an adverse reaction. I feel like the point of it is that if you do actually come into contact with that year's strain of the flu, it's going to protect you against it, not necessarily all strains of it, but like just certain components of it. So but I feel like where you disagree is that it's not a guarantee that you're going to get the flu. Whereas if you get the [Person A: right] shot, it's almost a guarantee. It's like you're subjecting yourself to something that you don't necessarily need to be doing. But I would say that like, say your mom got the flu, right? [Person A: mm-hmm] That would probably have been a significantly more adverse reaction than just to the shot, which is like a limited dose of it [Person A: good point] But then again, you're playing with the like, it's probably more like less likely that you'd get the flu. [Person A: Yeah exactly yeah], so I understand that totally. [Person A: mm-hmm] And I even have felt that too [Person A: yeah] like a day after you get a shot, which I think is is normal [Person A: mm-hmm] and an expected result of getting [Person A: mm-hmm] vaccines, [Person A: yes] specifically, the flu shots such as injecting a live anti-viral or whatever it is [Person A: yeah yeah] into you to build resistance to it. [Person A: mm-hmm. Right. Right] But I think that that proves the efficacy of vaccines and that you are reacting to it [Person A: exactly] and then after that reaction, you then build up an immune response to it. Yeah. Um, but 

Person A  3:55  
Really good points, though. I mean, I think [Person B: yeah] that Like you said, the whole point of it is to kind of build up your immune system [Person B: mm-hmm] so that you're able to kind of resist it if it actually does show up. So yeah, I see the value. [Person B: Yeah] you see
