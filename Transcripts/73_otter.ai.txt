Okay, so I understand like the opposition, and I think the death penalty should only be used if there's like 100% evidence and in ideal situations where people know that factors such as like waste or like income inequality um would, you know, create some sort of bias where the person is like wildly penalized, but what I add to this question, I was just thinking back to like uhh a rape case that happened, I think in like 2012 in India, which was like, very popularized [person A: mhm] about like, a gang rape, that was like extremely brutal and like led to the woman's death. 

Person A  1:48  
Yeah. 

Person B  1:49  
So I was thinking like, along those lines, especially since I'm like of Indian descent myself [person A: mhm] when the penalty is used in like a very extreme situation like a gang rape that leads to like someone's death. And it's also maybe the penalty is used to almost like prevent this situation from happening again [person A: mhm] in a culture where like it happens like way more times than it should, then I'm for it. But I know like a lot of complications happen when like in America often like black men are like put under the penalty without like [person A: mhm] enough data //. So I was just thinking of like a personal example.

Person A  2:31  
I just disagree with the premise [person B: mhm] that you could never be 100% certain of someone's guilt, um and I would rather live in a society where um revenge is not the norm of the law [person B: mhm]. Um I definitely get the impulse [person B: mhm] to take revenge, especially in a case as heinous as that one. Um but I don't think that you could ever uh guarantee that everything happened like you have the details fully right. And I don't think the government should be in the business of our /  of our bodies [person B: mhm] and like taking someone's life, and also you cited a case in India, but this question is specifically for the US.--

Person B  3:10  
--oh for the U.S., okay, got it, got it, [person A: mm] yeah--

Person A  3:11  
And the US is in--we have other I'm- I'm not saying India doesn't have [person B: mhm] this kind of deterring structures, um or um that the US has culturally. Um but we have other structures that are more um apt for deterrence, then um the death penalty, which is proven to not be a deterrence especially, or within the research of in the US [person B: mhm] and the UK and Western--European countries. I do understand how that might be different [person B: mhm] in places with dissimilar cultures [person B: mhm]. And um I don't know I just sa- this was the topic-- I hate discussing this kind of thing. 

Person B  3:40  
--yeah--Yeah, I was just thinking like, maybe in the US. It's like a mass-murderer like those famous ones who killed like 40 people, you know [person A: mhm].
