So I, when I read this question I thought about, like, myself as a underrepresented minority woman, typically in Ivy League schools, like my demographics would probably be one of the least. Um like, least visible as like a uh Latina woman. And so I was thinking um that there are positives to the university knowing about my background, because, like, I don't know, that could help with like, giving me opportunities. I don't know, wa-wa-what were you thinking when you read it?

So, uh I-I actually uh read a lot about this topic, and, uh uh but from my understanding, um there is a very strong legal case like-- uh being blind to a candidate's race to a large extent  is necessary under uhh decisions, uhh relevant decisions from the Supreme Court and other and there are uh  a current cases  working through the court system uhh with the aim of uh clarifying that decision. And uhh I think the primary consideration should be uhh that the Ivy League institution being uhh recipients of federal funding must follow the law.

Person A  1:30  
Ok and so what does the law say? Does it say like, or what did the study show?

Person B  1:35  
So the I believe it is part of the Civil Rights Act, that states any institution receiving federal funding um must not differentiate discriminate based on like race or  uh color or nationality or gender I think. And this is part of like uhh the civil rights act. Which is obviously uhh a very important part of uh of the American legal system. So, this is the primary consideration.

Ok, umm, another thing I was thinking about is, even when like you don't say specifically what your race is or like what your background is, or anything, a lot of times based on like stuff that ends up coming out in your essays are like based on what your name is even like, do you think like it should just like take off your name when they're looking at that application? Because I feel like a lot of times just based on the name like, you can tell.

Person B  2:32  
Well, that is that is possible, but there are numerous methods that uhh schools can be required to um do their best to kind of not consider a candidate's race. 

Person A  2:47  
Ok

Person B  2:48  
In addition, I should add that um there are certain research that uh points to a possibility that uh admitting a candidate that is significantly below average of cause if that would not have been the..
