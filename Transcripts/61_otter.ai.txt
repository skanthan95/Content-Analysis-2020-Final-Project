Person B  0:49  
[laughs] Yeah, I guess we disagree a lot about this. I think I see volunteering as a very good thing, because I feel like it teaches you your civil duties to your community. And it also teaches you that you are not just in a little community of like minded, like, you know, 20 something people. Um, so I think it's very good, but I feel like part of its value is in the fact that people choose to do so out of their free will. And I feel like once you make something mandatory, it's no longer a volunteering experience. It's just a mandatory a compulsory kind of event. 

Person A  1:36  
Yeah, that's ok that's a very good point, actually. Um, I guess part of the reason that I, I believe in is because I had a very personal experience with this. I, my university requires that we do that we volunteer by the time we graduate, and I really found like a whole new career path through it. 

Person B  1:56  
Ohh, mhm. 

Person A  1:56  
So and I and I know that I wouldn't have come across this career path if I hadn't participated in the volunteer experience that was required for me.

Person B  2:05  
mHm.

Person A  2:06  
Um ya, and also, yeah, so it just opened my eyes up, I guess to new things that I didn't, that I didn't previously think I was, I wasn't planning on doing. Had I not been required to do it. So that's, that's, I guess, the requirement part. The other thing is that yeah, I think, I think a lot of the end of there's a lot of students out there like me as well, who probably would not necessarily would not necessarily volunteer, I guess if they weren't given. If they weren't, like told, like, "Hey, this is a good idea." 

Person B  2:15  
mHm. mhm. 

Person A  2:34  
you know, because there's obviously so many things going in college, or, you know, whatever in life, you know, sometimes sometimes someone telling you outside of your circle, like hey, you should really do this. And kind of maybe guiding you or somewhat 

Person B  2:49  
mHm. 

Person A  2:49  
forcing you or requiring you in some ways. Um shows you something more about yourself and just makes you challenge yourself on that like. "Should I should I be volunteering or should I not? Why wasn't I doing this already? Why did it take someone to ask me to do this?"

Person B  3:06  
Mm-hmm.

Person A  3:06  
Also Yeah, yeah, it opens your eyes from whatever kind, whatever sphere I guess it is.

Person B  3:08  
Mm-hm, ya I totally agree with that. So can we like yeah, 

Person A  3:17  
[laugh]

Person B  3:17  
Ya, maybe we can agree [both laugh] that you can agree that like maybe like some kind of incentive for doing so very..

Person A  3:23  
Yeah, yeah. 

Person B  3:26  
Yeah, as long as I in my opinion, like, as long as it's not something that takes away from that experience.

Person A  3:33  
Mm-hmm. 

Person B  3:34  
 But like some kind of moderate incentive to get people to do that because yeah, people are lazy [laugh].

Person A  3:39  
Yeah. yeah

Person B  3:40  
They're not gonna do that without a little bit of a push.

Person A  3:43  
Yeah, but I mean, you have a good point as well.
