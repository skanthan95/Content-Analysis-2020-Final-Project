--Um I am obviously not against the death penalty. I think it's necessary, um a necessary punishment, just because the prison system isn't perfect. It you know, the judicial system isn't perfect. Um there are several loopholes. And I think this is more of like, I think this serves the public more than the, you know, I think the biggest, the biggest counter argument I've heard is that it's not our it's not our right to kill others for um others I've heard is that like--

Person A  1:12  
--I want to be clear. I'm worried that I filled this out wrong. Do you think the death penalty should stay in place? 

Person B  1:18  
Yeah. 

Person A  1:18  
Okay. Okay. I just--okay, [laughs] [person B: laughs] keep going. 

Person B  1:22  
So okay. So um, yes. And I think it's a good countermeasure for the public as a deterrent. And a it's almost like a release that, yeah--for extreme crime--

Person A  1:40  
--So I just want to be clear, um because the judicial system isn't perfect. This serves as like um--

Person B  1:49  
--a garauntee--

Person A  1:49  
--it'll scare people--

Person B  1:50  
--sure--

Person A  1:51  
--from committing crimes just because we aren't sure the justice system will actually catch them. Like is that I just want to be sure that--

Person B  1:55  
--sure--

Person A  1:56  
Okay. 

Person B  1:56  
Yeah.

Person A  1:59  
Well, I'm in law school [laughs]. So I think I have a little bit of an unfair advantage. 

Person B  2:03  
Oh my god, okay [laughs]

Person A  2:06  
But one of the things that I think I think you're completely right that the justice system, like there are issues with it [person B: mhm]. I don't believe the research supports that the death penalty functions as a deterrent. 

Person B  2:18  
Yeah, and I've read about that as well [person A: mhm]. 

Person A  2:20  
Yeah, [person B: mhm], so like [person B: mhm], I think that's like kind of where I disagree on [person B: mhm] I think ultimately, the way that it manifests is that it's an increased costs on the administrative side of the judicial process--

Person B  2:30  
--that's and because of the death penalty--

Person A  2:32  
--yeah, because like to take away someone's life is an insane like idea. So we want to make sure [person B: mhm] if we're going to do it [person B: mhm], we do need to make sure we check all the right legal boxes--

Person B  2:42  
--right.

Person A  2:42  
So like, we are very cautious of actually doing it and like understandably so [person B: mhm]. The problem is then people can constantly appeal their death penalty convictions because we want to make sure--

Person B  2:55  
--yeah--

Person A  2:55  
--that everything goes is like, everybody is up to par. And it's just like they can appeal even the concept of like the death penalty [person B: mhm] and being like, oh within the state the way they do it is unjustified because--ri-ri-right--
