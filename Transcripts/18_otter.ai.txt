Umm okay, so I said Ivy schools should be.. I completely disagree with this statement because I think umm there's a lot of inequality in the world. And I think that a lot of things like test scores and um recommendations [person A: mhm].. are there's a lot of privilege inherent in like test scores. Um I know people who are able to pay for test prep [person A: mhm] and they're like the class is like $300 [person A: mhm] so there's a lot of inequality disparity for test prep [person A: mhm]. And so if you just base things off of like scores or who has access to teachers, who will write them recommendations, or um just a lot of factors that are paying for application factors like that are like hindrances to um to the application process and to help stronger an application may look [person A: mhm]. And so I think that if you don't account for privilege, the most privileged people will look better in your eyes [person A: mhm]. And then so if you don't account for race, you might end up with a campus of all white privileged people.

Ohhh, okay, well, at first, I was going to agree, but after hearing what you said, it does make sense. Umm--[laughs].Let me think about this--at first, I was going to agree with it. Like when I did it on the survey, I kind of agreed that they should be blind to like, their race and ethnicity [person B: mhm] because sometimes I feel like it could affect like, their decision, although, of course, they look at test scores [person B: mhm] and stuff, but I don't know I feel like race always has to, like do something with like decision making [person B: mhm] because of like, just how society is like [person B: mhm] , you know, when we just yeah, I don't know I feel like /.  Yeah, but then when when hearing about like, how if you say like, if we don't, then we might have like a school full of like a certain amount of race [person B: mhm]. Like it also makes sense why we why they shouldn't be completely blind to us. So now I'm at like a 50/50 [laughs].

Person B  2:19  
And like this is not to say that like, only white students are like the best students [person A: mhm] .  I think diversity is like, for a lot of schools an important aspect [person A: mhm] . You can't like make diversity  a goal if you don't account for it. [person A: mhm]  So and I mean, I mean it does, like suck, that that's where our society is at, but we have to be proactive with like, the issues that we have [person B: mhm]. So and there's no such thing as like, the blind. 

Person A  2:47  
Yeah--

Person B  2:48  
To race, like what if they write about race and ethnicity and their um like essays--

Person A  2:52  
--true--

Person B  2:52  
--there's no, there's no such thing as like being blind to a canidate's race--or if their name, like you know how names are //-- 

Person A  2:54  
--that's also--yeah you can kind of tell by the last name as well.

Person B  3:03  
So there's like really no such thing. 

Person A  3:05  
Yeah
