Honestly, I think that, I think they should. All because that's you hear so many people getting hit by cars when they don't walk, don't pay attention to the red light. They just walk in a lot of people get into a car accident.

Person A  0:37  
Yeah, I appreciate the point about, you know, it being dangerous and causing unnecessary deaths at all. But I think when it's very clear that it's a, you know, one way street, you cross the street every day you see there's no card, then waiting for the red lights seems to be just waste of time. That takes. It may usually doesn't take that long. But it's the frustration. I think that's [Person B: the waiting] the waiting, Yeah.

Person B  1:06  
And I mean, I agree. But I guess because I-I see it so much on the news, mostly. umm. A lot of children who do it usually get hit, but you're right. It all depends on where you are in. Who's paying attention.

Person A  1:28  
Yeah, I-I think, I think the perspective that you have about you know, children is really important, especially because I guess for adults is not really a problem. You can kind of

Person B  1:39  
You don't really hear of that, it was with adults. [Person A: Yeah], more so like teenagers and little kids, or especially when they get out of school. That's what you mostly hear about it. 

Person A  1:50  
Yeah, maybe, maybe it's, maybe it's more important that we kind of set an example like a something for children to look up to. So that, you know, if they think that we cross the street all the time when it's when the light is red, then they think it's all gonna do it. But you know, they might not move as fast. I think so, yeah, I-I guess all and all.

Person B  2:19  
Leading by example? [laugh]

Person A  2:21  
Yeah, leading by example is, it's a good idea.

Person B  2:29  
Okay and I think this question should say people, because mostly you don't really hear about adults doing this. You hear about kids, so we should say, should children, teenagers avoid walking across the street against the red light, even if there are no cars inside? [Person A: Yeah], instead of saying people, because you rarely hear about people. You're more so about the children and we gotta lead by example.

Person A  3:02
That's a good point.
