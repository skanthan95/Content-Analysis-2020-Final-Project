So, about this point I really don't care if the US lowers its drinking age or not. I think it's not relevant for me. I think it's fine as it is. [Person A: Uh-huh] If I put like a 10 it means that I agree that point zero I mean, the disagree. [Person A: Uh-huh] I have no opinion. So I put a five [Person A: Yeah, appreciate it.] Yeah. 

Person A  1:27  
Well, umm I guess yeah. I'm glad you thought of that. [laughs] Well, as for me, um, I just compared it with like other countries. [Person B: Yeah] And 21 seems a little bit too high. [Person B: Yeah.] And also, like, for example, in China and other like Asian, Asian countries, [Person B: Yeah.] it's probably like 18. And you're, and you can find them in stores and so on.  [Person B: Yeah.] And also, another thing is, even though the drinking age is 21 in the US,  [Person B: Yeah] a lot of like coll-college students and like rven high school students doesn't doesn't follow- 

Person B  2:03  
Exactly like, [Person A: right.] They can just get their parents to like, go buy them alcohol. [Person A: Yeah] Or they can just get fakes which are like so common [Person A: Yeah, exactly] So even if there is a drinking age, there's not really a drinking age in the [Person A: Yeah like]  that's what I think you like people who really wants to drink, [Person A: right] will find channels to drink so you know I-

Person A  2:22  
And the and like, it's not on the same level as like, uhh for some other other things like [Person B: Yeah] driving ages or so [Person B: Yeah]. like, umm coll-, like college students and like high school students at who does participate in drinking as like, the rate of those. The rate like the portion of those uhh-the students [Person B: Yeah yeah] or other under age people [Person B: Yeah] is actually pretty high. Like, if you consider them as breaking the law [Person B: Yeah]. And therefore I don't think it's like, It really suits what actual like what in reality is happening? So, probably you can lower it [Person B: Yeah] a little bit for like to 18 [Person B: Yeah] and then get a little more strict on the on the, on the regulations-

Person B  3:12  
And I don't understand why it is at 21. And I feel like it being at 21 already, there must be some reason behind it. [Person A: Yeah, yeah, I appreciate it] I don't understand. But I also do understand why I understand where you're coming from, you're saying that you should, I mean, since everyone's already doing it you might as well just lower the [Person A: yeah] drinking age. Umm it's not really anything bad coming from, like, people that are younger drinking, like [Person A: mm-hmm] you have in other countries where the drinking age is not lower [Person A: right] There's not like any, you know, negative impacts in those countries. So I mean, I understand both points. I mean, I understand your point of view [Person A:  mm-hmm]. I don't under I don't really know why the drinking age is so high here. [Person A: Yeah] but I think the lack of information makes me indifferent, like I don't really mind but I think that people who do want to drink will drink and people who don't [Person A: right] will follow the law and one so I guess that's about it. [Person A: Yeah]
