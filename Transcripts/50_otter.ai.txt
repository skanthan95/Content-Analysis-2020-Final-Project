So I strongly agree with the statement as long as medical condition permits, everyone should get a seasonal flu shot. Because I believe like if we have the medicine to like prevent it like why not? [laughs] Yeah. [laughs]

Person A  1:22  
I mean, yeah, I just I just think um putting bacteria in my body [Person B: sorry, what?] putting bacteria in my body even though I'm not sick you know this is something because if you get that shot, you actually get that sickness, right, in order to get anti-biotics right? [Person B: Yeah] So if I didn't have it all, why should I get it, you know?

Person B  1:43  
I mean, but I feel like you're introducing into your body at such a small dose that it's so that your body can create like resistance to it or like fight it. [Person A: uh-huh] So if you could like help your body in that way before you get it like at a level or like to a degree that your body can't fight it like [Person A: yeah] why wouldn't you want to do that?

Person A  2:05  
I know, but I think you know, and especially for stuff like that happens in early age, you know, like, children [Person B: yeah] get the flu shots. They don't know what they're doing and I don't think it's right to just, you know, put something in your body, which wasn't there in the first place, you know? [Person B: Yeah]

Person B  2:21  
Okay, I feel like we have really strong opinions [laughs] [Person A: yeah] and like that's not really got change [laughs] [Person A: yeah] But, um, so do you not get vaccinated? 

Person A  2:29  
No, I've never got anything like, I mean, I got it uhh when I went to back home to Africa, we have to get some, you know? [Person B: Yeah] for medication for sure. But here like going to see {{}} and get a flu shot, I've never done that. 

Person B  2:42  
Okay. Do you have kids?

Person A  2:44  
No.

Person B  2:44  
Oh okay. {{{{{{{{}}}}}}}}

Person A  2:45  
{{}} Like you said, none of us is going to convince the other [Person B: laughs, yeah I know]. {{}} I guess for me personally I have been healing by myself and even when I'm sick I don't mean to take medicine like that, you know.

Person B  3:05  
Okay, well I am like very opposite. Oh, yeah.

Person A  3:10  
{{}} The only thing I need to take a second if I have headaches and work to function, even if I get whatever I have, I prefer to drink water through that. So just take my time you need to do better than taking everything.

Person B  3:24  
Yeah. But don't you like ever consider that maybe you're like putting other people at risk for not taking the vaccination.

Person A  3:31  
That's a good point. I mean, do you mean I guess I can start [Person B: Yeah]. That's a good point. I think my immune system by now is so strong that I don't even get sick like that

Person B  3:44  
Uhh that's like a very ideal world. [laughs] Okay. [laughs] 

Person A  3:53  
I mean yeah but this is a good point you make but by actually getting that shot So now that I can become sick as well, so I put other other people at risk as well right [Person B: yeah]
