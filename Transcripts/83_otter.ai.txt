Absolutely. I agree that um volunteering in the community is a good thing, but I don't think it should be a requirement that students are forced to do the volunteer job because maybe um if they don't want to do the volunteer job, but they are forced to do so for they won't, like devoted to the community service. They may just do it as a job and do it like maybe very bad. So in the end, it's more bad for the community. That's like, yeah--

Person A  1:24  
No, I-I disagree. And the reason I would say that is, especially in a community like this, where college students come into a community, and they take advantage of all of the whether it's social or uh community related uh benefits of staying in that community without attempting to give anything back to the community, um and I strongly disagree that uh a college student feeling forced to do something um is disincentive enough for them to not do it. I think that I think it's about responsibilities. College students are forced to do stuff all the time that they may not want to do. But it's a part of the experience and it's a part of the obligation of being in college. And so I just feel like the, the giving back to the communities in which the colleges uh sit is a really important part. 

Person B  2:23  
Yeah, even like it's really important, but I think um maybe it shouldn't be an obligation maybe like if they gave more to the community, they would get a bonus maybe they will get some um, maybe they would get some um..I don't know but I just think um students should be motivated to give back to the community, but they shouldn't be like required that you must give back to the community.

Person A  2:49  
 And I disagree because I believe that if not for the requirement, you may not get enough students that are motivated and if you have, for example, 80% of the students that don't feel motivated enough to give back, but all 100% of the students are taking advantage of the amenities of the community. Um and they're walking on the same sidewalks as people within the community, but they fly in and they were they rolled in during universities in season time, and then they roll out when the season is over, without understanding the impacts of the community. And I just think it should be a part of something required at college. 

Person B  3:35  
But wasn't like maybe the community services to like help uhh students to learn something and if they are like forced to do so, they won't, like devoted full heartedly to the community service, and maybe it would could a massive impact.
