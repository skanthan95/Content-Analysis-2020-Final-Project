Okay. Um, yeah. So, I believe that they should be blind only because of these heuristics that we have in our minds that like, while we don't want them to be playing a part in a lot of these decisions, these heuristics, unfortunately, are just what we have instinctually. And so inherently, those create biases, which those biases might play, in favor or against, depending on that person's specific background.

Person A  0:49  
Well, I disagree with what you're saying, because I think that these biases that you're talking about could be beneficial in terms of like helping people who have… had access to less resources on their way to college, for example, like, typically, like minority groups have, are in worse economical situations. And then you like the white person, your typical white person. So, I think I think affirmative action is a positive thing because even though like, if- if Ivy League schools were completely blind to a candidate, like race and ethnicity, then there would be a bias anyway, because people with like, people not in the minorities would have an advantage over people and minorities.

Person B  1:44  
No, that's just that's really interesting because I have the same reasoning but the opposite. [Speaker 2: Yeah.] So it’s just that like, if they see that they might make assumptions, but I mean I agree with what you're saying. I agree with everything you just said. [laugh] I just thought of it from the opposite perspective. But yeah I know, I definitely think that, like you're saying that we want to take it into consideration, but we just it's a balance, right? Like we don't we want to take into consideration but we don't want it to be like, derogatory, like we wanted to be able to help someone but not hurts. Exactly. 

Person A  2:21  
Right. And so I- I think that Ivy League school should be blind should not be blind, because I think that's the best way for them to find this balance because like, I it won't, it won't be perfect, obviously [Speaker 1: mm-hmm.] like, so like, I think the classic argument is like, agents would [Speaker 1: Yeah] be discriminated against because, like, yeah…

Person B  2:43  
But then do you think that they should be blind to everything or sorry, should be transparent to everything or just to some things? 

Person A  2:50  
I think they should be transparent to everything. Yeah.

Person B  2:56  
Great. [laugh] I like that. I switched my side. [laugh]

Person A  3:01  
good conversation. That was actually well
