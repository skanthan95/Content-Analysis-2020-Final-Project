Okay, if I'm entirely honest, the five was because I was kind of undecided and I was like, [Person A: laugh] I don't really know how this is feasible, [Person A: right.] Um, yeah, I guess. I don't know. [laugh] hmm.

Person A  0:39  
Do you want more time to think about it or feel free to take your time.

Person B  0:43  
Yeah. I don't know. um. Can we just have a conversation? would be like this. [Person A: Yeah, definitely. Yeah.] I don't know.

Person A  0:49  
Um, I guess it is interesting. I think we just kind of took different perspectives. It was cool that you saw it from like a feasibility time point. Because I guess from me, I was thinking more of a theoretical approach, [Person B: okay, okay] sort of, um, ethically or morally, what was my perspective. I didn't really think of it as like, practically, how would this panned out, [Person B: uh-huh] but it was interesting to see that we kind of took different approaches to, like, perhaps, like, the timeline almost. So how you would implement this kind of thing? [Person B: mm-mhm] Yeah. Just to maybe elaborate a bit on my perspective. Um, I guess, I kind of feel like, if you're trying to do it based on merit, um, then it would just make a lot of sense to try to leave a lot of um biases out of it. um. [Person B: Yeah] That's just kind of my perspective.

Person B  1:38  
Yeah. I do think there is a space didn't, I hope there's a space in college admissions for like, trying to make sure that you have a diverse group of students [Person A: but, um.] in multiple ways, not just in terms of race and ethnicity. um. But yeah, I don't know. I don't know. [Person A: laugh] That worth like, hold the trouble that it cause, um, anyway.

Person A  2:02  
The diversity is is a really important point. And I'm glad you brought that up. Like, I think, in my perspective, it's not that I'm discounting um diversity, it's more so that in the flip side, right, there's a potential bias against diversity as well. [Person B: Yeah, sure, yeah.] Or rather, um, like it could be used as a negative against a certain candidate based on their race, [Person B: mm-mhm] potentially just, I mean, there's a lot of like, news articles about like, people switching their last names, and then that kind of results, you know, [Person B: Yeah] you know, or like, faking their their race either, right. So definitely, I think it is a super complicated topic, but I don't disagree that like diversity is a really important topic. 

Person B  2:44  
I think I would probably need to think more about why you would want, uh-uh, racial and ethnic diversity college and whether like, admission is the way to like address, [Person A: right, right] like, as opposed to like, like, I don't know, free college / or like, [Person B: mm-mhm] you know, or training or opportunities in the actual world or, you know. 

Person A  3:08  
That's a good point. 

Person B  3:10  
Rather than no. 

Person A  3:10  
Yeah.
