Okay, so I thought the, um, we should, um, we should not abolish the this penalty because, I mean, given the status quo, we're not like actively using the best penalty and the status quo. So I think the judges have like, because it's like the US has a long tradition of using like, past cases to kind of like, make sense of like, what happened to like make sense, so judgments. I think, because for such a long time, um, the death penalty was not as acted. I think the judges kind of like, has their own kind of like standards to kind of do it, but we could, but I don't think it's like necessary to just abolish it. Yeah, so that was my opinions.

Person A  0:54  
I disagree. um. I think that it should be abolished because, um, there's always a, there's always a chance. My main very, my main opinion is that there's always a chance that an innocent like an innocent person is wrongly accused and was convicted of, convicted being guilty. And that small risk, in my opinion of, um, well, killing some, killing an innocent um human being is never worse um with ups like continuing um the death penalty.

Well then for example, if a person says he is sentenced to death, I-I mean sentenced to like in prison for life hundred years, [Person A: but] and he spends is like 40 years in prison and he dies. But it turns out, [Person B: he does..] we've like innocent being, is it still the same? 

Person A  1:41
It's the same thing. Yes. I-I understand, I see what you're saying. But, I don't think that's the right way to think about it. umm.Because even though he's the person would still be in prison, it's a com-, not {{}} experience anything but imprisonment is still in my opinion, a much better, uh. [Person B: Are you get the chance of like..] yeah, at least you're living life, you can still do things, you can still learn, you still, you saw that at some place, you still have access to it, like you can get educated in some ways, or you're still interacting with other people. But if you are just sentenced to death, um, first of all, you're you're you spend years often waiting for your, for your sentence for the day of your sentence. People are just kept in the dark. It's honestly a terrible experience because it's a terrible time. They're kept, they'd never know what's going to happen. They don't know that day they're going to die. And when the day comes, they're just told All right, this is the day you're going to die. And that's it. They have no nothing to look forward to. They just they know exactly how their lives are going to end. And again, like most of the time, I'm I'm sure they're right in sentencing people at least when they sentence people to death; but on the off chance that it's wrong, I feel like, um, it's it just outweighs all the good that can come out of the, um, death penalty.

Person B  2:56  
But on the other hand, that's still reason why support dealth penalty to some like South / because like because it, I-.
