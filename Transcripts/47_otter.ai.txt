Okay, um, well, I basically think, um, protecting the environment is really important. So, um, I mean, I'm, I have a background where I am actually, I'm from Korea, and then, um, we are actually, we do have to recycle things [Person A: uh. Yeah] and if not, we will be fine. [Person A: Okay.] And it's really helpful that you're being really conscious about what you're using and like what how, I mean, like the use of plastics the use of papers and so on. So I think it's at least helpful for people being conscious about their use and being aware of the environment [Person A: um-hmm] like state, status? I guess. [Person A: Yeah]

Person A  1:05  
No, I just, I would say agree like, recycling is really important. Like I'm from California [Person B: mm-hmm] and it was like / recycles, school recycle like, there was like there's a whole movement about that. But it's my personal thoughts, this is that like find something isn't the way to go. You talked about like their major of their decisions it's like, kind of like once they realized oh, there's an issue of recycling anyway like, it helps, It helps the world [Person B: mm-hmm] so my mission like feel the need to, yeah I don't know, to find this kind of like. I don't know, just was like find a kid for not throwing something is the right thing.

Person B  1:32  
 Oh, I see I see.

Person A  1:34  
 I guess I am more on the school, so like my office /.

Person B  1:36  
Oh, okay, I see. I guess I was like, focusing more on like they like being obligatory [Person A: Yeah.] recycling papers and then like the way, one of the most efficient way i thought was being like fine a, [Person A: Yeah] other than like anything else. [Person A: Yeah]  I don't know. I can't really think of another, um, option. 

Person A  1:56  
I-I thought like education is like good enough. [Person B: mm-hmm] {{}} School setting like, [Person B: Oh] / teach kids doing like, [Person B: mm] / recycling is good for the world, this is good for our planet and like, [Person B: Right.] then like, um, and I think, think the financial service kind of [Person B: mm-hmm], and this may fit for this kind of issue.

Person B  2:14  
I see. I mean i thought like school as being a university complex, [Person A: Yeah. mm-hmm] instead of like children school, [Person A: I know, yeah] so I guess like that's fair I mean like if you think about in a like school situation where you have like elementary schools kids [Person A: Yeah] like it's kind of ridiculous [Person A: Yeah] like I said, [Person A: Right] fining? I guess but like if I thought I was really thinking I'm like kind of a university context and then like office buildings like you're all grown ups. [Person A: Yeah] you know the obligation [Person A: Right], you need to be aware of all the environmental [Person A: Right] issue, some of them, [Person A: Right] you you should have the, Yeah

Person A  2:43  
So I was actually going to force again Korea, like how like it, is this like some like washing the trash like the, there is like side penal all the times? is like if someone catches you then.

Person B  2:52  
Well, I will say, um, not for schools [Person A: Yeah] at least, [Person A: Yeah]  but like, like for for like households [Person A: uh-huh] or like office like, mm, mm, like official buildings and so on like you will get fined, if you don't do the right cycling like if you don't use, [Person A: Got it] the right bin. 

Person A  3:08  
Okay, so they look through everyone's, got it, got it, I see. [Person B: mm-hmm].

Person B  3:10  
Yeah. so and then you you actually have to buy a specific like special bag for recycling [Person A: Okay], which is also like biodegradable. so yeah, I mean like that kind of like at least makes you conscious
