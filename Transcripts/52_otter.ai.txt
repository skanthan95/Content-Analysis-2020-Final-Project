I personally think that umm so basically the reason that we have traffic lights is because like, basically there are rules and then they're used to better {{}} either you know, but in this case it's better to say that like the traffic is doing well and that nobody you know, is hurting other people. But in this case, I feel like if we know that (\green) is not- if we know that there are no cars in sight, then {{}} is free of walking and then there's no point of you following the rules like as long as there's no cars in sight so that's why what Im indifferent because I do know that like people sometimes might just follow whatever rules that they want to follow so that's why I chose 5 as I am indifferent to it

Person A  2:02  
I see your point actually, I have thought in same way as well so I totally understand the reason why people think it's fine to cross the red line at one there's no side in the car because like the as you said like the reason why we have traffic light is to prevent any dangerous situation to happen if there's if there is no possibility for that situation to happen, it's fine to just cross [Person B: mm-hmm] the traffic light. But my opinion would be that if just covering this statement only, and in general case there's no car in sight doesn't mean that there's really no car around you. Especially one as far as I know. Umm considering my personal experience of seeing some of my friends driving a car, if they like (\lead) a very far, relatively far away from you they see a green light, and especially it's like an evening, not many people will be on the road, uhh they will drive quite fast, even like speeding up to cross the green light. And actually, that's a green light. So they think it's totally fine. While for the person if you see there's no car in sight at this moment, and you're just across the road in the middle, that very fast the car would probably just come and because this is a green light, they will just drive very fast and across the road and that's there's a potential danger within this behavior

Person B  3:34  
Gotcha, I think I agree with your idea there might be a potential danger, especially in the case of like maybe at night or on an empty road where the like the cars might drive super fast and then it just passes the person [Person A: mm-hmm]. {{}} Yeah, so I agree with your claim.  [Person A: yeah] I mean, the other cases, I do think that, you know, for instance, on college campus when I like when I'm crossing the midway for instance [Person A: mm-hmm] There are red light when students just tend to cross the street if they see no car in sight [Person A: I see] they know the car will slow down

Person A  4:10  
Yeah, yeah. [laughs] That's that's the case you
