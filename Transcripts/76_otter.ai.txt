Okay, so as to why it should be abolished, I put that I-I disagree which mean that I don't think it should be abolished [person A: mhm]. Uhhh I think my main thing, I want to say that honestly, it's just because it's existed for a while [person A: mhm]. Like I understand there are definitely cases where it was uhh like  improperly kind of sentenced [person A: mhm]. And I can see where that's like an irreversible penalty, but I think there are definitely certain cases where there's like irrefutable proof, for whatever it is that they're prosecuting someone for, I do think that there are crimes that are worthy of the death penalty [person A: mhm]. But I do agree, that there--I do think that there are definitely a lot of issues with how they should be carried out and how to make sure that--like different states have different standards for like what does and does not deserve the death penalty [person A: mhm]. So I don't have a super nuanced perspective on this [person A: mhm]-- full disclosure, this kind of more of a gut reaction. 

Person A  1:14  
Gotcha. Okay. I think mine is also similarly a gut reaction cause I also don't have like a very nuanced argument [person B: laughs]. I think it's mainly just like, I think it should be abolished, because I know like, obviously, like murders and things like that, like people who like intentionally, like harm other people, like, have done very bad things. But I think in some ways, the government does kind of take on that similar role, like, ethically--a release kind of--if they do decide to kill someone. And also, like, I know, if you look at a lot of like, people who have committed like horrible crimes like homicide and things like that, like they often have their own, like mental problems and mental disabilities that are just like untreated. So I think like, I know, it does take up resources and things like that, and like it's way easier to kill someone and also it does instill more fear. If they're like, oh, my God, you're going to be murdered. But I think like in the idea of giving everyone a fair chance like they should at least go to a medical institution and like try to work it out and maybe be like re released into society if it's like if they think it's like good for them but if it's not I think it's just fine to keep them locked up because in some ways like if you're going to argue for like a harsh punishment like I think the idea of like staying in prison for like 50 years is maybe worse than like just death because like that is kind of like a release like, yeah. 

Person B  2:24  
right. ok, yeah, I can see what you're saying-- 

Person A  2:28  
--um but that's why I think it should be abolished, yeah. 

Person B  2:31  
Yeah, that's perfectly fair [person A: mhm] that makes sense. 

Person A  2:33  
I'm not sure what else we should talk about [laughs]. Do you have any like I guess response about it uh? 

Person B  2:39  
Oh, yeah, I think the main main example that came to mind [person A: mhm] is like tortures [person A: mhm] people who are like so sporadic like serial killers [person A: mhm], like serial rapists [person A: mhm] and things like that--

Person A  2:49  
--yeah--

Person B  2:49  
--but just kind of the first thing that came to mind [person A: mhm], but I don't actually know, what crimes do ward the death penalty in other states like [person A: mhm] I actually am not sure of actual cases. 

Person A  2:59  
Yeah, no, same, I'm not actually sure, I just like assume like kind of what you said like--

Person B  3:02  
so it may change my mind depending on like what we're dishing this out for [person A: mhm]. Yeah.

Person A  3:06  
Yeah.
