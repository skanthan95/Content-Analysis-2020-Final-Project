Sure, I mean, I think it's definitely important to have race be kind of less of a factor in admission setting  [Person B: mm-hmm] because it's kind of a bias that when people are applying, depending on their race that affects their immediate chance of getting in. But I also think there is something to be said about trying to make sure you're fostering a diverse community in your school. So I think it's kind of a there's no right answer, and whether or not you fully consider the phrase or not, because on one hand, I think you want to make sure that your school represents a variety of beliefs and backgrounds [Person B: mm-hmm] , but at the same time, you don't want something that someone can control to affect their chances. [Person B: mm-hmm]

So do you think that race and ethnicity are determinants for what people feel /(risk?) could be?  

Person A  0:59  
Umm I like that you brought that up. I think that I mean, I think it can go both ways. I think that race can determine some factors just because of I wouldn't necessarily call them stereotypes but patterns among different racial communities but also that /(can be ?) regional communities based on people's upbringing and umm access to greater educational backgrounds. But I think there's also cases where it's less of a factor [Person B: mm-hmm] and it really depends on someone's situation.

Okay. Yeah-yeah, I would agree that people's beliefs are really tied to their regional identities and to their educational backgrounds. I think that personally, I don't believe that your racial and ethnic background holds as much sway as the community in which you are raised. [Person A: mm-hmm] Uhh because if you're raised in a community that is very similar to you, you will grow up feeling empowered  [Person A: mm-hmm], you know, you grow up in a community that is derogatory towards you, you will grow up feeling monster  [Person A: mm-hmm]. And I think that the people that raise you play much more of a role than the color of your skin  [Person A: mm-hmm] and your background, aside from backgrounds that are tied to /(resources?)  [Person A: mm-hmm]. But that would also imply that you were raised in a community that views that history in a particular way [Person A: mm-hmm]. So if you grew up in a community that use your history as something that has victimized you before, and continues to victimize you now, whereas if you grew up in a community that takes the past flips and allows you to be empowered by it, I think those are real determinants  [Person A: mm-hmm]. So at least for me, race and ethnicity are less of a factor than how you've allow that race and ethnicity to define your life  [Person A: yeah]. So to admit somebody purely on the basis of race  [Person A: mm-hmm], because you need to check off a certain amount of Middle Eastern students
