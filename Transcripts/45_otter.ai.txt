Um I think real large, I'm I'm I'm more or less, um, for the opinion that that post should be abolished. And my-my take on that is that the, um, it's just a pure cost thing, that like at the end of the day with all the humanitarian, hmm, considerations that go into, um, making sure that that's definitely a human. um, it becomes prohibitively costly, so like the effect of-of um giving some of the death penalty becomes, um, like basic one of them gets the most of their lives or many just don't get executed. So what's the point of even having this entire hoopla around, um, around having like a death penalty in the first place? Why not just have the maximum sentence for you, um. That's my opinion.

Person A  1:37  
Yeah, I kind of disagree because like you, you you execute that guy and like my costs less compared to that Giada expesne on like the-the-the full life sentence and I think like, compared to the suffering of someone who like maybe loss or family members or like, like an execution and like, es-es-especially for that might be a good solution for-for those sufferings. Yeah.

Person B  2:02  
Yeah, yeah, I can see what you mean, um, and I could see that you, maybe the family would get some kind of closure, um, for each specific case. I think, again written large I mean, I don't I don't profess to know a lot about these specific the specifics of the process, but my understanding from what I've heard is that the costs are like, um, immense. and I think I saw something on like john oliver, where they went into depth about power, um, you know, poison is administered and um, how disastrous it can be, for, um, instance, carols stories about people, um, getting bungled because of the-the-the inability to actually put together the, um, the right quantities of poison and not and not, not calibrating our lives. Like, it's just right with these problems and like, you can sympathize families, but the end of the day, like I don't know if it makes a huge difference. Like I mean obviously I can never know and I think anybody can really know except for the families involved, but it makes a huge difference in terms of how they feel about it.

Person A  3:07  
Yeah, cause like basically when I watch all these like criminal TV show, I think like the-the-the first requirement or like, the, when like for the for the for the victims like family members they are like all like execution like at the first time. I mean like and compared to the compared to the expense of like execution and like, and the expense on like the life sentence, I mean like the who have decided as taxpayer like, what if like, what it makes you more comfortable like to pay your tax on like execution, like for one time and then like, just killed that guy, like who did some like unbearable things are like you paid
