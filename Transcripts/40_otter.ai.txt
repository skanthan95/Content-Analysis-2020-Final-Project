Okay. hmm. I thought that they should be pretty much blind to, you know, and ethnicity when they making admission detail just based on the right candidates, hmm, {{}}

Person A  0:52  
Okay, I hear you and I understand what you mean, but I personally disagree. I think diversity within the university cultures is very important to learning and all students within the school. 

Person B  1:05  
But don't you think there would be some bias when it comes to like // when you are looking at someone  hmm {{}} like your personal bias?

Person A  1:14  
I agree that, that is not the best thing, but I think it's a necessary / to giving the students the best education they can get. Personally here, I've already noticed that meeting new people like [Person B: mm-hmm] people from Dubai, and France, [Person B: mm-hmm] and people from Mexico and Canada. I've actually learned a ton just from hanging out with him probably more so than I have classes. And I feel like if it was purely based off just your grades and ends up being a bunch of people from the same area,  [Person B: mm-hmm] I wouldn't get the same learning experience. [Person B: No, I agree that you should be..] {{}} students here.

Person B  1:43  
I agree that we should be considering like everyone's backgrounds, but I don't think it's fair to kind of like, [Person A:  mm-hmm], like, basically judge it within each race. 

Person A  1:54  
You say in each race? [Person B: Yeah.] I think it does make sense I can see what you mean. [Person B: mm-hmm] So you think it should be more based off of like culture [Person B: Yeah], rather than just ethnicity. [Person B: Yeah] I think that definitely makes sense. But I-I can see what the process [Person B: Yeah] how it would be, hmm, how it would be hard to do that, [Person B: Yeah], purely based off of just like boxes like UK. [Person B: Yeah] then anyone can sort of just pick whatever culture they want, [Person B: mm-hmm] you're sort of stuck with it, [Person B: Yeah] I guess, I, even though it's not exactly fair. [Person B: Yeah] It's a more definite way of making sure that separated cultures within school, just like [Person B: Yeah] very important, obviously.

Person B  2:26  
Yes. I agree. [Person A: What else?]. So what we are supposed to do..

Person A  2:30  
Yeah. I totally like, I feel like I see your side and I thought about this before how this conversation [Person B: Yeah] it's like, it's totally not fair. But I feel like it's like a, it's a necessary evil for learning. And if they think of a better way, I'm totally open to it.  [Person B: mm-hmm] Because it's not great.  [Person B: mm-hmm] I mean, yeah. So the better way was thought of I would be open to it. But currently, I just feel like in order to make sure that a lot of cultures are represented within us in the school,  [Person B: mm-hmm] this needs, this is necessary

Person B  2:56  
Yeah, that' s fair.  Probably great.
