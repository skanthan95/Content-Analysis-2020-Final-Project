Yeah, so I guess, because it said people shouldn't avoid, I think that it's important for people to be more aware of their surroundings because I've seen like so many people, [Person A: yeah], who's gonna run over, you know, and it tends to be the pedestrian small, but I think that I also see sometimes when like cars will kind of just pass by, [Person A: mm-hmm], like when it's green for the pedestrian. [Person A: Okay] And so I just feel like maybe that contributes to a sort of like, you know, when people walk on red, it's like, sort of unjustified, but then when it is actually justified, people still tend to almost get run over. I don't know for me it's just, [Person A: mm-hmm], something that I've actually seen and like been problematic.  I'm also [Person A: Yeah] from San Francisco, California. [Person A: mm-hmm] So it's a big city. And I think that almost really convenient oftentimes does you know [Person A: mm-hmm] decide to walk...

Person A  0:56  
 cause there are so many stuff. [Person B: Yeah, there are somebody /] Yeah, everything is in street.

Person B  0:59  
Yeah, it's like, admittedly, I don't, you know, I don't follow what I said, [Person A: mm-hmm] I guess but it's like, I think that people should avoid, like, in the sense of avoid not necessarily [Person A: Oh] that they should, like refrain from doing so. But they should try to avoid it, if that makes sense. [Person A: Yeah] Like, I guess I created a distinction between two words.

Person A  1:02  
It's like, if they do do it, or don't have that feeling of like I shouldn't do this, maybe like, does try hard to? 

Person B  1:21  
Yeah, maybe aware, awareness, almost just awareness [Person A: awareness?] so that they, [Person A: oh] you know, it's like, if they if a car suddenly pops out of nowhere. I just want to hope, I would hope that people would be aware [Person A: uh] that it's a red light right? for them. But I don't know. I would love to hear your opinion.

Person A  1:42  
Oh, I don't know, like super strong opinion [Person B: yeah] for like, if it's a red line, there's no cars, I'm gonna walk. [Person B: Yeah] and it's still like, because there is gonna be [Person A: mm-hmm] for everyone else. And then I guess like, I agree with you like aware, but that's like what you say is the same as / a red line, you should always look for ways people they across [Person B: right], But other than that, like, I don't think you should avoid it, because as long as you look both ways, it should be fine, cause, again-again, like, sometimes people will go, just that that red or green is no guarantee that you're safe anyway. So I feel like as long as you practice safe um /  safe-walking [Person B: yeah], um, measures that you're good to go. [Person A:Yeah], cause sometimes you just like waiting their and like [laugh] [Person A: yeah], it's like it's just.. // you can't convince the whole nation to follow this [Person A: mm-hmm], taking with like people, like might be engaged to like uh encourage safe, safety? What's it, what's it happen? safe happen so I didn't, it's like going through this.

Person B  2:48
Yeah, I definitely can see that point. And also, I did want to your point about like, Well, you know, it might not be safe anyway. Like how, [Person A: yeah] you know, how can you guarantee safety and that's definitely true. [Person A: mm-hmm] I guess my point was just like, I feel like if people, like internally avoid doing [Person A: mm-hmm] so they might be more aware, if that makes sense? Like, you know, [Person A: Oh] for people who just, like won't avoid it. It's like maybe they're more...
