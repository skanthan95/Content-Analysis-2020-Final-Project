Um. So I disagree with this  because um I think never is a strong word. I think that if this prompt had said parents should usually not use iPads as toys for their toddlers, I would have strongly agreed, but I think there are some circumstances where uh getting a toddler to sort of be quiet--

Person A  0:36  
--Like on a plane--

Person B  0:36  
--For example, on a plane--

Person A  0:38  
--Yeah--

Person B  0:38  
--or uh in a private public space some times like that where the iPad can be like the only thing that works so that's that's where I sort of am coming from. 

Person A  0:48  
Right, so I'm super impulsive, and I didn't think before I tapped, I 100% agree. So I yeah, I see that. As soon as he put it down and I saw never I was like but what about on planes. Um, so my I had I have strong opinions about this because I was a waitress for a summer. And every single family that came in just stuck an iPad under their kids face and it was really scary. Pretty much dystopian. To see, like all these babies just like staring at the ipads. 

Person B  1:20  
Yeah

Person A  1:22  
And I um, what I ended up concluding that summer was that for parents to do it once it becomes so enticing to do it again, that it and especially if the kid has seen it once they know what they want. So it's, like better not to establish a first time and just do it because it always worked before ipads were a thing.

Person B  1:44  
That's totally true. And I feel like you're right that if it were never established, it would never become a crutch. Um I think it's unfortunate that it has become a crutch. So perhaps in that for that reasoning, you know, your your you're right that, just never ever doing it [coughs] would avoid the problem completely. Um but I don't know, I still feel like you know, given that there are tools now and maybe society's expectations of children being quiet have also developed and changed-- 

Person A  2:16  
--Yeah--

Person B  2:16  
--among their iPads becoming a thing that, for example, on a plane or, or, yeah, you know, somewhere where it's even potentially, like dangerous for the kid to be running around. Um and they just need to like, sit quiet in their stroller or whatever. In rare circumstances. I feel like the iPad can be a very useful toy, but I agree that it can get a little extreme. And the scenario you described in the restaurant, I agree is dystopia and very, very bad. 

Person A  2:46  
[laughs]

Person B  2:52  
Bodes poorly for the future.

Person A  2:54  
Yeah, especially because the shows and the apps often are..They're not as cultivated it's a lot of white noise content now um-- 

Person B  3:05  
Yeah
