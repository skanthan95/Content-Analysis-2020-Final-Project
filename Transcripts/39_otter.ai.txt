Person B  0:12  
How do you feel about this topic? [laughs]

Person A  0:14  
I think that the US should not lower its drinking age because umm I feel like a lot of people drink anyways and I feel like like under age and I feel like having consequences for that doesn't really stop them and it kind of just like ends up being bad anyways because like, I mean, I don't know 

Person B  0:33  
Wait, so you think they should lower the drinking age? 

Person A  0:34  
Yeah, they should. Okay. [laughs] [Person B: okay, so I think, okay] Yeah. Umm because like, I don't know if people get in trouble for drinking under age [Person B: yeah] like, everyone does it like there shouldn't be like a thing where you like get offended? Yeah, yeah.

Person B  0:49  
Yeah, I guess my I don't even remember how strong of my uhh [Person A: Yeah,] strong disagree I had in this. I think it was just that like, uh like, I feel like the argument for this is usually like, oh, other countries have lower drinking age and they have better uh  like, relationship with alcohol. But I think that that's like not a true statement like the better relationship with alcohol thing is like subjective[Person A: Yeah], so I feel like that that's probably where I base my opinion off of that like it doesn't mean people don't really follow the (small?). [Person A: Yeah] doesn't matter that much umm although like, I do see your point that like well I guess what I was thinking is that like, human brains are like [Person A: yeah] developed like need to develop so [Person A: Yeah] we should wait to drink [Person A: I-] haven't but I guess changing the law. [Person A: Yeah, I feel like]  wouldn't change anything [laughs]

Person A  1:44  
yeah, i feel like changing the law like like people would still drink but like, I feel like, like now that like a lot of people have like big ideas. So it's kind of like the, the lower like, having a drinking age at like 21 like increases people's {{}} of Like ideas and stuff, just like for person for this is like drinking one think they like are doing it anyways. And if it lowers it, I don't think it would make a difference and like people using it I just think that it's like much safer for like identification like,

Person B  2:15  
yeah,  [Person A: yeah]  I guess that's true. And I like I guess like if the USA did lower its drinking age, so I feel like it would have to be like a combined effort of like more education [Person A: yeah] about the {{}} because there are people who abstained from drinking because it's illegal, but like,  [Person A: yeah] yeah, everyone just doesn't do it. Umm but, like, a lot of people just do it anyway, but some people don't. So and I guess I just wouldn't have faith.  [Person A: yeah] with the government [laughs] to do anything  [Person A: I mean yeah] good with education. 

Person A  2:52  
Yeah, I feel like it depends also, like, it depends on like, how low they lower the drinking age.  [Person B: yeah]  I mean, like, I think Like 18 is like fine [Person B: yeah yeah] but not like not like  [Person B: yeah yeah] like 13 or [Person B: yeah yeah; laughs]
