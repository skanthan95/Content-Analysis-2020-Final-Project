Why do you think um we shouldn't umm mandatorily make people participate in community service?

Person A  1:47  
Ummm because, because college students-- well I feel like we already  did that in high school--

Person B  1:56  
--right--

Person A  1:56  
--and I feel like participating in community like volunteer activities is more about like you wanting to do them--

Person B  2:05  
--right--

Person A  2:05  
-- rather than like being like being a requirement. So, and the thing is like college students are already kind of overwhelmed with, like homework and stuff that's going on with their lives. And I feel like putting requirement and another requirement on top of that would make them even more stressed.

Person B  2:26  
That's all understandable. I didn't know because I've come from a different cultural background. Like I didn't go to high school US we never had the opportunity to volunteer [laughs]. And in fact, the volunteering was like a new concept to me [person A: uh-uh]. Like I didn't know what it was. And I saw some of my friends did like a really cool stuff at home [person A: mhm] or, you know, the mental hospital stuff. I was like, oh, that's really great. So--

Person A  2:52  
--yeah--

Person B  2:52  
--But like um, it's like really great but right. I think you're right too like if you already did so much in high school, college is really, really stressful. [person A: mhm]

Person A  3:01  
Yeah, I just think it's, it's um, yeah, honestly I think volunteering should be kind of well for yourself but also for like, the other person that you're volunteering for and if you're not doing it because you want to and you're being forced to do it, it just might have like a--it just might bring like negative impact to the organization that you're working at. So, yeah.

Person B  3:30  
That's true. Yeah, that's great. Are you from um UChicago? Are you studying? 

Person A  3:35  
Yeah, are you? {{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}}

Person B  3:36  
No, I graduate here earlier but yes, I'm already like very old for college age [laughs]. I very // think oh we should force students but like of course [person A: laughs] you would think the no. Don't force it on us.

Person A  3:51  
Oh wow, when did you graduate? 

Person B  3:53  
2014 I think-- from here, and then I umm well I remember, we didn't have any mentoring community service there was like just our advisor emailing people say there's just interesting thing you want to do a join and stuff. ///Do you have mentoring like right now like----community service--

Person A  4:15  
--oh, wow--.Oh, wow. Uh-uh. No, No, we don't. But I-I volunteer at like local elementary schools. I just do art projects with the kids. 

Person B  4:23  
That's so cool. 

Person A  4:24  
Yeah, I really like it.
