So I think the physicists, physician assisted suicide should be legal in the US because people are going to commit suicide anyways. And I feel like if you have kind of an avenue for someone, like if it's a more talked about topic in general, [Person A: mm-mhm] then people might be more willing to reach out for help versus feeling like they have to be in a completely alone and I'm sure that there's a whole process before you actually have the physician suicide [Person A: Yeah. uh-huh.] just screened to make sure like you're the right case. And I'm sure that some of the people who actually like want to commit suicide would be willing to go down that route versus doing something that could seriously injure themselves, [Person A: uh-huh] or like not end up with full death and like, destroy like part of their brain. So I feel like it should be legal because I think it was just making a more talked about topic, which was then under public. 

Person A  1:31  
Okay. Because honestly like, I feel like, I feel like this is a pretty process but yeah, I don't understand why has this wrong that. [Person B: laugh] But, um, I think like there are a few like, okay, I think you brought up a really interesting point like people should have like, like autonomy over their like, [Person B: Yeah] death but they should, they should have like this kind of like capacity of like deciding they're going to like have the right to die or not. [Person B: Yeah.] But I think like, I think there are a lot of cases where like, it's really hard to tell like if someone like is really like conscious of themselves, like, are they actually. [Person B: in a mind a] Yeah, are they like actually in the right situation like they should choose. Like, like suicide, like they like, for example, like in hospitals a lot of like, like, I guess like patient when they like kind of a mistake of like unconsciousness, [Person B: yeah] like consciousness like [Person B: yeah, yeah, yeah]. If you just like, say like, um, I actually accuse this kind of like physician like assisted suicide to them like it might, it might not be like if they're like, in their like benefits to like suicide so like as a, as a, I guess as a valid tool. Like the patient like if you have the choices you can do it. You can do like whatever you want and like potentially, like harm, like the patient like their, their like, I don't know, like their benefits again. 

Person B  2:51  
Yeah, I mean, I think that like there's a lot of testing before someone actually does physician assisted suicide, [Person A: Yeah] so they would like to approach their doctor and be like, hey I'm interested in this for XYZ reason. [Person A: mm-mhm] And then they probably go through a ton of screening before they even [Person A: Yeah] allow them to do something like that, like, including the screening of are they in the right space. So I feel like because of that it would trigger more people to actually talk about it. [Person A: mm-mhm] And when they're feeling like they want to commit suicide, and they might not be in the case of actually having to do physician assisted suicide, they might not be in that group of people that should, like have it done or like that are okay to have it done. They might actually be in the group that they're not in a mental headspace but then at least people know, versus them quietly doing it themselves in an apartment is like kind of a thought. So I feel like more than anything about this was
