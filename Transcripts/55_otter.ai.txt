Person B  0:20  
Oh, okay. Just making sure. Um, yeah, I said like people, college students should not be required to volunteer in the community. Um, just because, like, I mean, obviously volunteering is a good thing objectively, but like, I don't see a reason to like, force people to volunteer. I like I like for some people like they have very limited time...

Person A  0:43  
Yeah.

Person B  0:43  
...for them. Like, like, I'm really I'm feeling a loss like, you know, students have to like work a part time job, like, may not have time to volunteer. So I feel like putting putting an unnecessary burden for all like what I believe is like, not necessarily like I I just sort of feel like there's not really a need to like force people to volunteer, like we should encourage it but like, it should not be like, mandatory....those were my thoughts..

Person A  1:08  
I definitely get what you're saying. I appreciate what you're saying about, like students who have a limited amount of time. And I definitely think that is the case. But I think like, there are a lot of different forms of volunteering that students can like participate in and I think it's kind of a way to like get some some hands on experience like I know that, um, for a lot of students like a a mandatory volunteering is like one of the only ways they can really get involved in their community because a lot of a lot like I know a lot of people here don't engage in engage like the Hyde Park community all that much. I think it's important to not have like the University so isolated from the area around it.

Person B  1:46  
Yeah, so I feel like we both agree it would be good for volunteers...

Person A  1:50  
Yeah. 

Person B  1:50  
...I just like, like, for example, like how would you even want to enfor-,  like my question's like how are we even going to enforce this right. Like, like how would you prove that like I volunteered at like something. Like like I I just don't see how this could be feasible to enforce.

Person A  2:03  
Yeah, that's a good point. I think it would be half...

Person B  2:05  
Like I feel like I could lie about this very easily.. haha..

Person A  2:06  
Haha.. Yeah. I think you'd have to, um, have the school organize it to some degree. Um, but I think yeah, you're right that I would I think once the school starts to organize it, it would probably get more complicated. I think you're right that like, in theory, it's a good idea. But in practice, it would be more difficult, but I think like, even if it doesn't work out perfectly, it would still be better to have like, a a majority of students like actually volunteering rather than like the students who are willing to, like try to find a way to get around the system. I feel like that would be a smaller proportion of students that like would actually just...

Person B  2:18  
Okay, so like so they're always going to be like bad actors in the community, but like, just like, yeah, putting a requirement, well, is like, encourage people to volunteer, is sort of what you're saying.

Person A  2:49  
Yeah, Yeah, I think like, um ya..

Person B  2:50  
I feel like that's fairly reasonable...

Person A  2:54  
I think like most people, like probably wouldn't actively volunteer and you said like, do you want to do this, but if they had a requirement to, I feel like most people would it be so strongly opposed to it that they'd like find a way to get out of it. I think most people would just like go along.

Person B  3:09  
Hmm. Okay. Well, seems like we're out of time.

Person A  3:15  
Okay, cool conversation.
