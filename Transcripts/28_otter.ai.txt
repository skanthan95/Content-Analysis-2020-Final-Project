Umm is this as long as medical condition permits? What did they mean by that? I didn't get the first part.

Person A  0:28  
Um the first part, I think, I mean, um like, as long as like, I don't know--

Person B  0:34  
--things stay the same kind of--

Person A  0:36  
Ummm as as long as you're able to-- like get get a flu shot or something. I think so. I I disagree what you're saying because umm where, I mean, like, this is my first time in the US and like, where I was in the Netherlands. Um flu shot was not a thing [person B: mhm]. So I feel like here it's like such a big thing. And it's like, it makes people be a lot a lot scared of it. So yeah, that that would be why um I disagree.

Person B  0:39  
--to--Okay, well they they also told us that we would disagree so [laughs]

Person A  1:04  
Yeah, yeah

Person B  1:05  
 Um, I would say umm I would say I agree because I think for I grew up here umm and I think kind of like for the society itself to have fo-fo-for society itself to have like lower rates of I think like public um medical assistance is better than like none so I think it should be available for anyone who wants it a public health that's what I'm saying public health and I think this is part of public health cuz um  I don't like the divide between the very rich and the very poor  as much so if we can help the people who are not as fortunate, then it's better for society, I think I believe it's better for society as a whole if everyone is getting medical treatment, but I do understand the other half of like there are parents who are like, why should I force--be forced to have my kid get a flu shot for school and stuff? 

Person A  2:10  
Yeah. 

Person B  2:10  
So it's definitely a controversial question.

Person A  2:12  
Yeah, I think I think yeah, I really I really doubt like what you were saying because like, just just like, I feel like um people are so focused on like, seasonal flu shot and again, it's such a big thing here.

Person B  2:23  
Yeah.

Person A  2:23  
 And I feel like they're, they're not like really focusing on like other other diseases that are like, much more relevant and much more important. And even though it's it is a it is a great thing to like focus on like seasonal flu shot, because you know, it is it is really important. I think it overshadows like a lot of other diseases. So because of that, I-I disagree.

Person B  2:42  
[laughs] I think that like um I can see, I mean, it's, it's been in the news, it's a very controversial thing. And you know, it also just a question of people's personal beliefs, you know, versus what people's beliefs for the entire side of society are. So it's definitely a tricky question.

Person A  3:01  
Umm yeah.
