Sure. Um, so I believe that I answered saying that like kids younger than 12 years old should sometimes be allowed to have phones. I am pretty sure I did. And it was mostly because like, my parents would sometimes like pick me up at different times from school, so I need a way to contact them. Um, yeah, {{}}

Person A  0:33  
My parents did the same thing. I think I actually like a five {{}}. [Person B: Okay] Because in general, I'd say kids shouldn't use like cell phones like smartphones because I was just like, when they're kids like they should be more present like active when using like phones, but like in Emergency Situations I feel like kids could have phones like I got one in fifth grade. Like it wasn't {{}} [Person B: Gotcha, yeah.] I feel like we are mostly agreeing on this {{}}

Person B  0:57  
Yeah, I think I didn't like strongly disagree. [Person A: Oh okay] Because I feel like it's getting like more and more important to be able to contact people with the phone. Umm-yeah. [laughs] 

Person A  1:17  
For the purpose of disagree, [Person B: yeah] I guess, kids under the age of 12, and suddenly use phones as as much of a crutch, as like we are using like for kids now, like, they get it at age like five when they grow up having a phone. [Person B: mm-hmm] And like, my mom would always say, like, oh, back in the line, when I was a kid, we would go out and it's like, afternoon and come back and night. And there wasn't such a reliance on like, instant communication. [Person B: Yeah], and so I feel like in our current day, like everyone having phones it like takes away from like, it's like \(over-not over say?), I feel just like, it becomes a crutch and like a distraction. So they don't really know {{}}.

Person B  1:56  
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I can see how like, they don't really know how to mmm like if they get a phone from a  really young age, they won't know how to, like ever not have a phone. Umm and there's a lot of like, science obviously that shows that like attention spans are lower because of phones. Umm but I think that like uhh it'll be like important to also be able to I don't know. Yeah, really the one reason I thought that was because I was like they should children should be able to contact their parents at any time [Person A: Yeah] umm or like other family members. Yeah. And I think I'd like see enough kids who have phones, that it would be maybe like socially weird to not have one [Person A: Yeah] Umm yeah. 

Person A  2:47  
A lot probably argued with \(others sticking up), like not having a phone as being bad. That shouldn't be in play. [Person B: Yeah], I think it's another thing my phone's {{}}. It takes away like your problem solving skills. It's like all your answers are like on a device
