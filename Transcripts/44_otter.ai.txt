I think people should avoid walking across the street even there is no red line, even there's no car inside. I mean, It's like a law and I feel like as people, you should follow the law and once like, you start crossing the street, but even when there's no car, but then you like, get this mindset in your head. So whenever like, you see a red light cause it's just like, oh, there's no car then I should cross, but then what if one day this car comes really fast and it hits you. You know, I-I just think it is not. First of all, like against the law. Second of all, you developed a bad mindset.

Person A  1:26  
Yeah, I get what you mean and I-I-I do appreciate your concern about the, um, the issue with developing into habit and, and, and issues related the law further. But I-I would personally disagree because, well, that part about there are no cars on the side. That's kind of your own personal judgment and you should take responsibility. I-I think we should take responsibility for that. And really check there are no cars inside before you go. But because like everyone's on a schedule, so and being from a city myself, a lot of people do this and it's quite, it's quite normal. And I'd say it's quite safe. So maybe, maybe you will say that I am, in a sense, habituation. Like when you mentioned, [Person B: Yeah]

Person B  2:16  
You said normal, is their right?

Person A  2:21  
It's safe. It's safe as far as I know. But is it morally correct? Is that what you mean, [Person B: Yeah, I mean morally correct]. is that what you... Well, yes, that's a that's a big that is a concern. But I think most people, I think most people would not really,um, consider about what's morally correct and incorrect or in their day to day life. So I like they might thoughtlessly throw away, throw away plastic and the non recycled box collection section. It's quite a normal-normal human trade. It's not necessarily morally correct, but I think in this case. The main issue isn't necessarily morality or other safety. [Person B:  um- hmm]. and yeah, like I said..

Person B  3:07  
But there's like, I mean, if there's a police by you and you're crossing the street when there's a rent like he could give you fine. So, I mean, it's like, you definitely, I-I think I'm taking it from a different perspective. 

Person A  3:21  
Yeah. Definitely. I understand. Yeah, that-that so you mean a perspective of, just to clarify, the perspective of the policeman potentially seeing me? 

Person B  3:31  
Like, just like, first of all, like when it's morally correct, and then it's against the law, you know, that's my..

Person A  3:38  
Oh, I see. I see. 

Person B  3:39  
Yeah.
