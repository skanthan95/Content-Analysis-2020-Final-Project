Person B  0:48  
Yeah, I think it should in certain cases, but not all cases, because I know like, especially for Asians, like, just in general. I believe decisions can discriminate. So taking into account race and ethnicity. That's like one form of discrimination, definitely. 

Person A  1:05  
Yeah. I quite appreciate that point. 

Person B  1:07  
Yeah. [laughs]

Person A  1:08  
Because for many..[laughs]

Person B  1:11  
[laughs]. Yeah, yeah definitely. 

Person A  1:13  
Sure. Because for a specific group of people, they just 

Person B  1:16  
Right.

Person A  1:16  
gave it so low weight and 

Person B  1:19  
Right.

Person A  1:19  
It causes anti-discrimination discrimination. 

Person B  1:22  
Right 

Person A  1:22  
like that. 

Person B  1:23  
Yeah, I think it's meant to be like anti discriminatory, but then it discriminates against, like for certain people.

Person A  1:30  
Mm-hmm. 

Person B  1:30  
I mean, like, for some races, I guess, like maybe, I think here, at least in America, like if you're, it depends a lot because we think like Native Americans and African Americans is disadvantage, but I think it should be more based on income. If If anything,

Person A  1:46  
Ohh.

Person B  1:46  
 it doesn't always have to be based on income. Because you can be like me Asian, you can be really poor. 

Person A  1:51  
Right

Person B  1:51  
And I feel right, you're succeeding. 

Person A  1:53  
Mm-hmm.

Person B  1:53  
Well, that means you're obviously intelligent, right? 

Person A  1:57  
Right. 

Person B  1:57  
I should be looked higher, not negatively. And you can be like Native American,

Person A  2:02  
Mm-hmm. 

Person B  2:02  
 and be very rich. And so you really like should you get an advantage in college admissions? 

Person A  2:08  
Yeah, I quite appreciate that point.

Person B  2:10  
Yeah

Person A  2:10  
 because we're income as a confounder for the decisions, we should really adjust for that. 

Person B  2:17  
Right. 

Person A  2:17  
Um, and for an actually for rich people, they don't have like a certain tendency to be specific race..[laughs]

Person B  2:27  
Right, right. Yeah, exactly.[laughs] this is true. So yeah, I'd be willing to like, honestly, I don't think it should be race and ethnicity, but anything income because it that that will take an account until like people who are disadvantaged.

Person A  2:40  
Mmm.

Person B  2:41  
 I don't know to what extent race plays like in you doing well, rather than like income because it's more money and more resources. And yeah, definitely I can. Yeah, I can definitely see that point. I don't know why I put it so low. [laughs]

Person A  2:58  
I can't, I can't agree more.

Person B  3:00  
Yeah. 

Person A  3:01  
Because for for rich well should have less to do with the schools things.

Person B  3:08  
Yeah.  

Person A  3:08  
It's just the meaning that the family has more resources.

Person B  3:12  
Yeah,

Person A  3:12  
but does that mean because people have a little resources could be hard work, like working harder..

Person B  3:19  
Yeah, there's always money to, like, and since like applying to schools is so competitive too..

Person A  3:24  
Mm-hm.

Person B  3:24  
...and you can't like just base something on like, just race
