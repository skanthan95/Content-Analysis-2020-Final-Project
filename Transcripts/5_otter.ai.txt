I actually didn't look much into the legal system here, but for death penalty, I think like, if..I think if someone committed to a really serious crime such as umm very like, like murdering people and like not being regretful about that and then um like continuously doing a lot of things that will harm the security of the society and also the people around them. I don't think there is any reason why this person could continue to live in this society,

Person A  1:01  
Yeah, like definitely, like, I definitely see what you mean what the reason I personally am against the death penalty isn't because I don't think some people should be from removed society because if you have like someone who's like, I don't know, like a terrorist who, who knows people indiscriminately or something like that, you know, I think they should be removed from society, but at the same time, you know, in terms of like implementation a lot of the time. So like, in the US, like, when someone is sentenced to death, like, the, just from, like, there's, I guess there's two perspectives, there's like, the sort of pragmatic perspective and then there's, like a moral perspective, like, and just from, like, the pragmatic perspective, you know, like when you're talking about like, like, I've done a little bit of research into this. Uh like, it actually costs more to send it to like, uhh an execution because there's a ton of like checks to make sure that you're not executing the wrong person like  even even in spite of that every once in a while, you know, like people after their execution are exonerated by DNA evidence and you know, you can't undo a death sentence but you can undo a Life Sentence 

Person B  2:01  
I see what you mean. 

Person A  2:02  
And then the other thing is like from like a more like moral perspective or not not even a moral perspective. But like, I remember I, I haven't actually read the study. But I remember reading that there was a study that said that like the death penalty isn't any worse than like a life sentence, like life without parole when it comes to punishing or when it comes to discouraging crime. And like when it comes to um what is it? And then like some people, like, from certain points of view, you know, a life sentence without parole might even be a worse punishment than a death sentence. Because with the death sentence, you know, you're you're dying, like you don't have to stew in prison and think about what you've done, you know? With the life sentence, you know, you're left to live the rest of your life, you know, thinking about what to did if that makes sense?

But I guess that, um I don't know. I just don't think we should really care about the moral aspect of it as like in the society is working and the moral values are /(consuming?)/changes so I think like if you decided something based on the moral power--
