Person B  0:06  
Okay. Um, so I feel like people shouldn't walk across the street [laughs] um at a red light, but I think I put like a nine for it because I was like, well, if there's literally no cars [Person B: mhm] then like, I think it makes sense to walk [laughs] across the street with a red light. Um, but yeah, I think that's just because I have this in my head like very like [laughs] strict rule code of traffic like, if it's a crosswalk then I feel like people should always be able to go [person B: mhm], but when it's red light, I'm like, okay, you like have to stop [laughs]

Person A  0:34  
I do appreciate that point, um it's kind of funny 'cause you said that this is like the one of the ones that are like less like uh--

Person B  0:40  
--right?--

Person A  0:40  
--controversial. So I put a zero on this--

Person B  0:43  
I put a nine, [laughs] that's funny--

Person A  0:46  
Um so, [Person B: laughs]. That's funny. So I am one of those people who will not be able to do a conversation without letting you know I'm from New York [laughs]. So there you go. 

Person B  0:52  
Yes----that makes sense. Yeah, no, I think I grew up in a in well, I grew up in a smaller city, but like everyone had a car. So I [laughs]--

Person A  0:56  
--yeah-- --Ohhh--

Person B  0:59  
--I think that um, I don't really drive in Chicago, but my boyfriend does. And I literally get scared every single time I'm in a car with him because I literally think he's gonna hit someone [person B: mhm] if they run [laughs] across the street infront of a red light. Like he's like, you should be allowed to [laughs]--and I'm like no [laughs]. So, yeah [laughs]

Person A  1:18  
Yeah, no I totally get that [person B: laughs]. I think that like.. Um, I don't really drive at all. [Person B: Mmmmm] So I guess I don't really know what it's like from like from the other side of it. 

Person B  1:31  
Yeah. Um, yeah.Um..[laughs]. I don't know. I think it is something like I think I am. I do know about myself though that I am more like, people will think I'm ridiculous. They'll be like Madison, like, you can just go on like, no, like, I see a car so I'm gonna wait. But if there's like no cars----I'll still do it.--So if I can see a car coming, then I usually wait. 

Person A  1:47  
Yeah. Yeah. --yeah--Oh, it's honestly probably super obnoxious, but like, [Person B: laughs] I feel like you'll see people,coming and you'll just go for it.

Person B  1:55  
No, I definitely think it's different. Yeah, and you're just like whatever. 

Person A  1:59  
Yeah, so like my. [laughs].

Person B  2:03  
[laughs]. Um, Uhh I don't know how much more, yeah--

Person A  2:11  
--Yeah--I'm not super like, angry [laughs] about this issue.

Person B  2:14  
Umm. Yeah, yeah me either. I [laughs] definitely thought it was gonna be a more--

Person A  2:18  
--yeah--

Person B  2:18  
--like [laughs] hot topic issue. Um, yes. So yeah, it's probably just because you did grow up in a city and like I grew up in a city where everyone had cars so,

Person A  2:31  
yeah. Yeah,  I think it's also just like when you see like everyone knows what to look for, like those cars are already blocked so [laughs] might as well join in --Yeah, 

Person B  2:35  
Like that crazy busy intersection. Oh, for sure. 

Person A  2:37  
I feel bad for them [laughs].Yeah

Person B  2:37  
But I feel like when I'm crossing you know, like the the big street from like the reg to get on to like campus?I do. I'm like, oh my god, but I still walk because I'm like, well, you know, I mean?

Person A  2:50  
Yeah.

Person B  2:50  
 Like, what, like, I'm gonna stop here. Just you know what I mean? 

Person A  2:52  
Yeah

Person B  2:52  
Like, you no, like, I'm gonna go with like this big herd of people just because. 

Person A  2:56  
Yeah it was actually funny about that because I think I honestly do see /. Like you guys are not going to pass any time soon. 

Person B  3:01  
Yeah, because that's the time when it's like blatantly obvious like in between that passing time where you just literally see herds--
