Okay, um, so I put a four, I like very minorly disagree um because ok.. I definitely get annoyed when, like, parents just like sit down their kid and they're like, here look at the-- look the iPad. Um because like...yeah, I mean, I'm sure... yeah, you know..Um but I think sometimes they can be really helpful like if they if it helps them, like, focus on like an educational program that like maybe helps them like, learn math to--. Like yeah, get better or like have um, I don't know, have like a head start before starting school. Um or like maybe the parents aren't very available because they have really tight work schedules. Or like, are in a working class family and they just like need to, like have this way of teaching their kid something. Um I don't think it's ideal, but I think it can help in certain circumstances.

I disagree. [Person A:Okay] I put I put a 10 for this. [Person A: Okay] Looking at the question, uhh toddlers to be implied, well, you're probably under 8 maybe under six. So have like using IPads is really, really bad for their sight and it's going to have [Person A: ohh] long term consequences. I think just using um trying any device  all is really bad because you're not socializing. Usually if they're learning something, they're going to be with a teacher, a parent, some human interaction which is like fundamental to the early childhood development. You're  not getting that with this. [Person A: Yea]  
And I think also, such early iPad use early really just encourages that idea of like these things are normalized and should be in major part of life which really they shouldn't and they should only be a tool rather than, like a, an attachment means to achieving things. So then yea, I disagree with that. 

Person A  2:08  
Yeah, I agree with those points. But I think like, some people, like don't have the resources to, like, be there all the time with their kids, or like, um they're just like in a really bad situation. Or um like they, they can't really hire someone because it's really expensive. Um and like, I think if there is a solution then like that, could be one, ok, like, really developed apps or something, that like know childhood development um that could help especially if the parents are not educated in like early childhood development, which many are not--they're like not prepared in that way. So, I think that could potientially work. [Person B: Yea] I do see your point--

Person B  3:03  
I think you're missing a point because still it would be really bad for their health, their eyesight and--
