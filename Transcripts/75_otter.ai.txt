Person B  0:10  
Ok, so as I was saying, um yeah, we should really avoid because umm if you get into an accident, first of all, it's your fault, so you can't do anything-- you have no claim against anybody [person B: mhm]. Yeah, I just don't think you should cross a red light.

Person A  0:24  
Yeah, that makes sense. I definitely is, like, a little more dangerous. I think though that the part of the statement that I mainly disagreed with was, if there are no cars in sight, like I feel like that's okay, if you're in a rush, and it's like, you don't see anything anywhere. 

Person B  0:38  
Yeah.

Person A  0:38  
I feel like there's no harm in that. Although I see your point and I agree that like--

Person B  0:43  
--yeah--

Person A  0:43  
--if you're if there's if it's a dangerous situation, and there's a red light the red lights there for a reason. 

Person B  0:47  
So I had to do it again--this is yes. And this one, yeah, maybe [person A: mhm].

Person A  0:52  
Yeah, that's the other part of  this, yeah.

Person B  0:54  
Kind of both ways--

Person A  0:56  
Yeah, I agree [laughs]

Person B  0:59  
I've done it before when there are no cars in sight, and then when I cross, they came, you know like driving really fast [person A: mmhm]. Because that's the only way.

Person A  1:08  
Yeah, that makes sense. I'm not sure what we're supposed [laughs]--yeah, mhm, I'll-I'll I guess I'll just say something else cuz just for the point of the conversation [laughs], I suppose. Um--

Person B  1:25  
Yeah.

Person A  1:27  
Yeah, I guess I guess, I'll say this--yeah, I don't know. I don't know what else to say other than--

Person B  1:33  
I worked at the hospital on the other day uhh a guy- a teenager in a skateboard was just run over [person A: mmm]. And um I'm not quite sure what that light was, but imagine if it was related to that.

Person A  1:46  
Yeah, true--yeah, there's definitely a lot of accidents that could be avoided. 

Person B  1:50  
Yeah.

Person A  1:55  
mhm [laughs] um, yeah. I don't know what to do if we end early.

Person B  2:06  
If I to had to if I had to redo it again, I would probably wouldn't have rated it an 8 [person A: mhm]..I was I didn't pay attention to the-- if there are no cars in sight--if there are cars in sight, I probably would still uh--

Person A  2:16  
--yeah--

Person B  2:16  
--just to be sure, be safe, I would probably have waited and like I'm // [person A: mhm]

Person A  2:22  
Yeah, I also wouldn't have rated it so low.

Person B  2:24  
What did you rate it at?

Person A  2:25  
I rated it a zero because I was mainly thinking about this statement. 

Person B  2:29  
Yeah.--right, right--

Person A  2:29  
Which like // it's kind of silly, if there's like no repercussions,-then there's no harm. 

Person B  2:35  
If I had to redo it, it would be a five or a four [person A: mhm] not an eight. I'm a nurse--

Person A  2:38  
Yeah, oh well [laughs]. I feel like that's good enough.
