Okay, well, um, I remember that I agreed somewhat strongly. It's about um high school students, high schools offering healthy options in campus cafeterias just because I think that um that is I guess it's generally a good idea to offer um healthy options. I guess maybe the the point that could be a little contentious about that people make it um I think in general if you're gonna offer either only healthy or only unhealthy it should probably be on-only healthy foods. Um, I don't know [laughs].

Person A  0:49  
Yeah, I think I I appreciate that. That the there should be healthy options. I-I have to admit I, I doubt we're going to disagree very much [person a: okay, laughs]--because the only thing I really took into was the only part and it seems uhh unnecessary to me to restrict people's food options and I mean I've definitely had days where all I really want is some fried food. 

Person B  1:11  
Yeah, that's definitely true. I don't know [laughs]. I feel like I had stronger opinions on different, certain other topics but yeah, um we'll go with food options

Person A  1:23  
Uhh--

Person B  1:24  
I guess it's definitely important to offer a variety of options maybe and maybe most of them should be healthy, I guess like but yeah, I do understand. Yeah, I totally get it. That sometimes, you just want to eat fries. Today, I just want to eat fries. Yeah, it's fine [laughs]. Ummm--

Person A  1:44  
I, I guess I I agree that you should have a variety options. But why? I mean, why should most of them be healthy? Why shouldn't just one of them be healthy? 

Person B  1:54  
Yeah, I don't know--I think as a person who like I generally try to um be more careful about eating vegetables and salads and that kind of stuff um. Just so I feel like I'm not eating only um more unhealthy foods. Um, I guess it just matters to me that I have like a variety of things I can choose from in that respect. But I guess I can also see the opposite point that it matters to have a variety of unhealthy things to choose from [laughs].  I don't know, I also feel like there is there are ways to prepare foods that are generally more unhealthy in ways that could be healthier, like depending on the kind of oil used to fry and that kind of stuff.

Person A  2:34  
I I appreciate that you like to [person B: laughs] eat healthier, and that's certainly true. But healthy food is also often more expensive--

Person B  2:39  
--that is true--

Person A  2:40  
--or to prepare the same food in a healthy fashion--

Person B  2:42  
--that's definitely true--

Person A  2:43  
--so if there was an option between more expensive healthy food or less expensive, less healthy food. 

Person B  2:49  
Yeah, yeah, I can tell that can be an issue. For sure. Umm, yeah, I don't know...good conversation.
