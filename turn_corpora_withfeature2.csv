So but I feel like where you disagree is that it's not a guarantee that you're going to get the flu. Whereas if you get the . shot, it's almost a guarantee. It's like you're subjecting yourself to something that you don't necessarily need to be doing. But I would say that like, say your mom got the flu, right? . That would probably have been a significantly more adverse reaction than just to the shot, which is like a limited dose of it . But then again, you're playing with the like, it's probably more like less likely that you'd get the flu. ., so I understand that totally. . And I even have felt that too . like a day after you get a shot, which I think is is normal . and an expected result of getting . vaccines, . specifically, the flu shots such as injecting a live anti-viral or whatever it is . into you to build resistance to it. . But I think that that proves the efficacy of vaccines and that you are reacting to it . and then after that reaction, you then build up an immune response to it. Yeah.
